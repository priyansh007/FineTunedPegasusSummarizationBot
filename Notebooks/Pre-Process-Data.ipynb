after he was captured on video punching a flight attendant in the head, according to justice department and airline officials.arrested: an orange county man is facing a federal charge after video captured him punching a flight attendant during a flight from mexico to los angeles. https://t.co/royxglrlv1 pic.twitter.com/6zg8e10x8uthe incident occurred wednesday on a flight from san josé del cabo in mexico to los angeles. alexander tung cuu le, 33, of westminster, in southern california, was arrested when the aircraft landed at los angeles international airport, according to an american airlines official. he was charged thursday with one count of interference with flight crew members and attendants, which carries a maximum penalty of up to 20 years in prison, said a statement by the u.s. attorney’s office for the central district of california. according to the statement, le grabbed a flight attendant’s shoulder and demanded coffee about 20 minutes after the aircraft took off. he also allegedly disrupted passengers by hanging out near the first-class section of the cabin. when another flight attendant told le to return to his assigned seat, le “allegedly stood up and assumed a fighting stance towards the flight attendant by making closed fists with both of his hands, which the flight attendant interpreted as a threat,” according to the doj statement. a video taken by fellow passenger barrie livingstone shows le apparently initially swinging his arm at the flight attendant but missing. as the attendant turned to walk away, le can be seen rushing forward to strike the attendant in the head, eliciting cries of concern and outrage on the aircraft. the attack was “witnessed by several passengers,” the justice department said. le then “fled” to the back of the plane, where he was “apprehended by several passengers” and crew members, the statement added. le’s “hands and legs were cuffed,” but he “continuously unbuckled his seatbelt, causing flight attendants to restrain him to the seat with seatbelt extenders,” officials noted. le has been barred from all future flights by american airlines. “acts of violence against our team members are not tolerated by american airlines,” said a statement from american. “the individual involved in this incident will never be allowed to travel with us in the future, and we will work closely with law enforcement in their investigation.” the airline thanked crew members and passengers for restraining le until the aircraft was met by law enforcement at lax. le appeared thursday at the u.s. district court in downtown los angeles, where he was charged. the hearing was continued to monday, ciaran mcevoy, a spokesperson for the u.s. attorney’s office, told sfgate. “that will be a detention hearing to determine his bond, if any. mr. le has not pleaded to anything yet,” mcevoy added. attacks on flight attendants have skyrocketed in the last two years, largely triggered by sometimes violent, defiant responses to requirements to wear masks earlier in the covid-19 pandemic. the federal aviation administration logged an incredible 5,981 “unruly passenger reports last year. in 2020, the faa investigated only 183 reports.trends reporter, huffpostby entering your email and clicking sign up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising

send the broadcast back to the studio, one of her anchors asked, “who’s that behind you?” ross turned around to find her boyfriend, robert tilearcio jr., kneeling in front of a banner that read, “will

remained without water service three days after hurricane fiona slammed into the u.s. territory, and many spent hours in lines wednesday to fill jugs from water trucks while others scooped water from mountain runoff.sweat rolled down the faces of people in a long line of cars in the northern mountain town of caguas, where the government had sent a water truck, one of at least 18 so-called “oases” set up across the island.the situation was maddening for many people across an island once again left without basic services following a storm.“we thought we had a bad experience with maria, but this was worse,” gerardo rodríguez said in the southern coastal town of salinas, referring to the 2017 hurricane that caused nearly 3,000 deaths and demolished the island’s power grid.fiona dumped roughly two feet of rain on parts of puerto rico before blasting across the eastern dominican republic and the turks and caicos islands.swelled to category 4 force, the storm was on a track to pass close by bermuda early friday and then hit easternmost canada early saturay, according to the u.s. national hurricane center.the storm played havoc with puerto rico’s electrical grid, which had been patched but never fully rebuilt after maria caused a blackout that lasted 11 months in some places.as of wednesday afternoon, roughly 70% of puerto rican customers lacked electricity, according to government figures.in caguas, the air conditioning of emayra veguilla’s car wasn’t working, so the bus driver propped up a small fan in the passenger seat. earlier, she had blasted the song “hijos del canaveral” (“sons of the sugarcane field”), written by puerto rican hip-hop star rené pérez as an ode to puerto rico and its people’s bravery.“i needed a shot of patriotism,” she said. “i needed strength to do this once again.”veguilla had waited in line tuesday, only to be told that the water had run out and that another truck would not be available until wednesday.some people ahead of veguilla gave up and drove away, with tensions running high the longer people waited.“move!” yelled one driver, fearful of people trying to cut in.some who saw the line opted instead to drive to a nearby highway where fresh water trickled down the mountainside via a bamboo pipe that someone had installed.greg reyes, an english teacher, stood in line in muddy flip-flops to collect water for himself, his girlfriend and their cat. he had brought a large bag holding all the empty containers he could find in their house, including more than a dozen small water bottles.reyes said he and his partner had been buying water since fiona hit, but couldn’t afford to do so any longer.standing behind him was retiree william rodríguez, surrounded by three large buckets and four gallon containers. he had been living in massachusetts and decided to return to puerto rico about six months ago.“but i think i’m leaving again,” he said as he shook his head.those in the line grumbled about the slow pace of recovery and accused the government of not helping them as people on social media and even a gym said their doors were open to anyone who needed water or a shower.“this hasn’t been easy,” said juan santos, a retiree who held the hand of his 5-year-old grandson. “we are suffering.”none of those in line had power either, and many wondered if it would take as long to restore as it did with hurricane maria.power company officials initially said it would take a few days for electricity to be restored, but then appeared to backtrack tuesday night, saying they faced numerous obstacles.“hurricane fiona has severely impacted electrical infrastructure and generation facilities throughout the island. we want to make it very clear that efforts to restore and reenergize continue and are being affected by severe flooding, impassable roads, downed trees, deteriorating equipment, and downed lines,” said luma, the company that operates power transmission and distribution.officials said crews found several substations underwater and inaccessible.but luma said it expected to restore power wednesday to much of puerto rico’s north coast, which fiona largely spared.the hum of generators could be heard across the territory as people became increasingly exasperated.“i continue to hope that by the end of today, a large part of the population will have these services,” said puerto rico gov. pedro pierluisi.the head of the federal emergency management agency traveled to puerto rico on tuesday and the agency announced it was sending hundreds of additional personnel to boost local response efforts. on wednesday, u.s. president joe biden approved a major disaster declaration, which would allow for more federal assistance.meanwhile, the u.s. department of health and human services declared a public health emergency in puerto rico and deployed a couple of teams to the island.in the turks and caicos islands, officials reported relatively light damage and no deaths, though the eye of the category 4 storm passed close to grand turk, the small british territory’s capital island, on tuesday.“turks and caicos had a phenomenal experience over the past 24 hours,” said deputy gov. anya williams. “it certainly came with its share of challenges.”officials said school on grand turk would reopen next week.the hurricane center said fiona had maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 kph) late wednesday. it was centered about 550 miles (885 kilometers) southwest of bermuda, heading north at 10 mph (17 kph).fiona killed a man in the french overseas department of guadeloupe and two others in puerto rico swept away by swollen rivers. two died in the dominican republic: one killed by a falling tree and the other by a falling electric post.two additional deaths were reported in puerto rico as a result of the blackout: a 70-year-old man burned to death after he tried to fill his running generator with gasoline and a 78-year-old man police say inhaled toxic gases from his generator.___associated press journalists maricarmen rivera sánchez and alejandro granadillo contributed to this report.by entering your email and clicking sign up, you're agreeing to let us send you

huffpost“we inherit our family’s dreams, but also their fears. it takes a lot of courage to make your own path.”that line of narration from the new documentary “mija” — spoken by one of its subjects, musician and music manager doris muñoz — has stuck with me for months since its sundance film festival premiere in january.the documentary follows muñoz and two of her clients: first, singer/songwriter cuco and later, singer/songwriter jacks haupt. muñoz’s success as a manager representing fellow latinx artists has provided material support to her family. in the film, her parents are undergoing the arduous and bureaucratic process of applying for green cards. muñoz, the only u.s.-born member of her immediate family, is also the liaison between them and her brother, who lives across the border in tijuana after he was deported.in “mija,” muñoz and haupt grapple with a lot of complicated feelings that are familiar to many children of immigrants, especially those trying to make it in a creative profession. they want to live up to their parents’ expectations and make them proud, and feel obligated to help them and honor their enormous sacrifices. amid all of that, they’re figuring out how to make it in a field where there aren’t a lot of people like them. premiering friday on disney+, “mija” is the feature debut of director isabel castro. she previously spent a decade in journalism, producing documentary shorts and series at the new york times, the marshall project and vice, where she was an emmy-nominated producer for “vice news tonight.” as she explained in an interview, the seed for “mija” came from a desire to tell more nuanced stories about immigration — not just about the act of immigrating or the policies behind it, but the complex emotions it brings up and “the ripple effects across different generations.”“the range of emotions that comes along with immigrating to this country is really, really nuanced and complicated, and the spectrum is really wide,” she said. “oftentimes, immigrant stories are very narrowly focused on exclusively the trauma of that experience.”it’s the kind of story castro has wanted to tell for many years, and the intersection of several of her creative goals. as a mexican american journalist covering immigration and civil rights in the trump era, castro “started to feel really disillusioned by the kind of aspirations towards objectivity,” she said. “just looking at the ways that different government policies were affecting folks on the ground, it was very difficult for me to really try to maintain objectivity.”castro, who has a background in filmmaking but cut her teeth in journalism and documentary tv work to build a more steady career path, quit her day job and used her savings to get back into independent film. she took a course in cinematography to be able to work independently and reduce costs, since getting a film funded can be a long and cumbersome process.when considering what story she wanted to tell, she remembered that “i’ve always loved music docs. so i thought, ‘oh, maybe there’s a way to have a music doc intersect with a story about immigration,’” she said. “and that’s kind of the seed that was planted.” in 2019, castro came across a california sunday magazine profile about cuco, which mentioned the work muñoz was doing as his manager. after several phone conversations with muñoz, castro met her in person later that year at “selena for sanctuary,” a concert paying homage to the late singer and icon selena. a few years earlier, muñoz began the event as a way to raise money for her parents’ legal fees, and later grew it into a fundraiser for immigrant rights organizations. soon after the two met, muñoz agreed to be part of the documentary.when deciding to move away from journalism and make her own feature film, castro also wanted to be able to make more specific stylistic choices. “there’s objectivity, also, in the vernacular of imagery that journalism is told in. and i wanted to make something that felt really subjective, that felt really intentional about its pov and about the image itself being part of the messaging and the story,” she said. for instance, “mija” features a vibrant color palette and dream-like sequences, which were inspired by hbo’s “euphoria.” “in terms of trying to react to or deviate from the typical ways that immigrant stories are told, i really wanted to adopt a visual language that felt really young and exciting, and so i looked a lot to ‘euphoria,’” she said.in choosing to have muñoz narrate the documentary, castro drew from the voiceover of characters like cher horowitz in “clueless” and carrie bradshaw in “sex and the city,” which she loved as a teen. “i really connected to carrie and cher, despite our huge differences, just because of the vo. i felt like there was an intimacy that was established through the voiceover,” she said. “so i always knew that i wanted to emulate that in the voiceover for the film.”like everything else in the world, the pandemic shifted muñoz’s life and the course of the documentary, forcing castro to get creative with the production limitations. “i went into this thinking it would be a more traditional music doc. i thought i’d be on the road. i thought it was going to be a chicano ‘almost famous,’” she said. “but the pandemic hit, and my expectations just completely went out the window.” while we didn’t get that road movie version of “mija,” the film’s intimate moments of reflection lend itself well to the complicated questions it explores — the kind that don’t fit into a pithy headline or neat narrative.for children of immigrants, in some ways, perhaps the ultimate gift to our parents is to get to make the choices they couldn’t, and to be able to move beyond basic questions of survival and material needs. but it also can be hard for our parents to understand our choices, and we can feel a sense of guilt for being able to focus on less material concerns than they did.“one of the emotions that i personally carry with me and most wanted to explore in this was the feeling of guilt,” castro said. “and i think that that’s particularly prevalent in the stories of immigrants because migration just is inherently a traumatic experience. no matter what your story is, it’s a decision to leave your home, and it’s a decision to leave your country and your culture and move to a new place. and it’s painful.” “and i think that as children of immigrants, oftentimes you see that pain or interpret that pain, and you want to honor it,” she continued. “and sometimes, that comes along with a lot of pressure, and that pressure often comes along with feelings of guilt. so i wanted to explore those kinds of emotions. i wanted the film to live not just exclusively in the trauma of immigration, because that’s always going to be there in our lives, in our stories and in our day-to-day experiences.”castro wants more immigration stories to capture these more complicated feelings and questions. “the nuanced emotions are the ones that i think come up more often on a day-to-day basis,” she continued. “having covered immigration for many, many years, that is the reality of most people’s experiences that i see. it’s not something black and white.”“mija” premieres friday on disney+.senior culture reporter,

aggression” in ukraine is an affront to the heart of what the international body stands for as he looks to rally allies to stand firm in backing the ukrainian resistance.biden, during his time at the u.n. general assembly, also planned to meet wednesday with new british prime minister liz truss, announce a global food security initiative and press allies to meet an $18 billion target to replenish the global fund to fight aids, tuberculosis and malaria.but white house officials say the crux of the president’s visit to the u.n. this year would be a full-throated condemnation of russia as its brutal war nears the seven-month mark. “he’ll offer a firm rebuke of russia’s unjust war in ukraine and make a call to the world to continue to stand against the naked aggression that we’ve seen these past several months,” white house national security adviser jake sullivan said in previewing the president’s address. “he will underscore the importance of strengthening the united nations and reaffirm core tenets of its charter at a time when a permanent member of the security council has struck at the very heart of the charter by challenging the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty.”the address comes as russian-controlled regions of eastern and southern ukraine have announced plans to hold kremllin-backed referendums in days ahead on becoming part of russia and as moscow is losing ground in the invasion. russian president vladimir putin on wednesday announced a partial mobilization to call up 300,000 reservists and accused the west of engaging in “nuclear blackmail.”biden is confronting no shortage of difficult issues as leaders gather this year.in addition to the russian war in ukraine, european fears that a recession could be just around the corner are heightened. administration concerns grow by the day that time is running short to revive the iran nuclear deal and over china’s saber-rattling on taiwan.when he addressed last year’s general assembly, biden focused on broad themes of global partnership, urging world leaders to act with haste against the coronavirus, climate change and human rights abuses. and he offered assurances that his presidency marked a return of american leadership to international institutions following donald trump’s “america first” foreign policy.but one year later, global dynamics have dramatically changed.stewart patrick, senior fellow and director of the global order and institutions program at the washington think tank carnegie endowment for international peace, wrote in an analysis that biden’s task this year is “immense” compared to his first address to the u.n. as president.“last year, the u.s. leader won easy plaudits as the ‘anti-trump,’ pledging that ‘america was back,’” patrick said. “this year demands more. the liberal, rules-based international system is reeling, battered by russian aggression, chinese ambitions, authoritarian assaults, a halting pandemic recovery, quickening climate change, skepticism of the u.n.’s relevance, and gnawing doubts about american staying power.”beyond diplomacy, the president is also doing some politicking. this year’s gathering comes less than seven weeks before pivotal midterm elections in the united states. shortly after arriving in manhattan on tuesday night, biden spoke at a democratic national committee fundraiser for about 100 participants that raised nearly $2 million, and he’s set to hold another fundraiser on thursday before heading back to washington.his wednesday address comes on the heels of ukrainian forces retaking control of large stretches of territory near kharkiv. but even as ukrainian forces have racked up battlefield wins, much of europe is feeling painful blowback from economic sanctions levied against russia. a vast reduction in russian oil and gas has led to a sharp jump in energy prices, skyrocketing inflation and growing risk of europe slipping into a recession.biden’s visit to the u.n. also comes as his administration’s efforts to revive the 2015 iran nuclear deal appears stalled.the deal brokered by the obama administration — and scrapped by trump in 2018 — provided billions of dollars in sanctions relief in exchange for iran’s agreement to dismantle much of its nuclear program and open its facilities to extensive international inspection.sullivan said no breakthrough with iran is expected during the general assembly but biden would make clear in his speech that a deal can still be done “if iran is prepared to be serious about its obligations.” he added that administration officials would be consulting with fellow signatories of the 2015 deal on the sidelines of this week’s meetings.this year’s u.n. gathering is back to being a full-scale, in-person event after two years of curtailed activity due to the pandemic. in 2020, the in-person gathering was canceled and leaders instead delivered prerecorded speeches; last year was a mix of in-person and prerecorded speeches. biden and first lady jill biden were set to host a leaders’ reception on wednesday evening.china’s president xi jinping opted not to attend this year’s u.n. gathering, but his country’s conduct and intentions will loom large during the leaders’ talks.last month, the u.n. human rights office raised concerns about possible “crimes against humanity” in china’s western region against uyghurs and other largely muslim ethnic groups. beijing has vowed to suspend cooperation with the office and blasted what it described as a western plot to undermine china’s rise.meanwhile, china’s government on monday said biden’s statement in a cbs “60 minutes” interview that american forces would defend taiwan if beijing tried to invade the self-ruled island was a violation of u.s. commitments on the matter, but it gave no indication of possible retaliation.the white house said after the interview that there has been no change in u.s. policy on taiwan, which china claims as its own. that policy says washington wants to see taiwan’s status resolved peacefully but doesn’t say whether u.s. forces might be sent in response to a chinese attack.___follow ap coverage of the u.n.

soccer federations who want their captains to wear an armband with a rainbow heart design during world cup games in qatar to campaign against discrimination.france and germany, the last two world cup champions, were among eight of the 13 european soccer teams going to qatar who joined the “one love” campaign, which started in the netherlands. the dutch team plays qatar in group a on nov. 29.fifa rules prohibit teams from bringing their own armband designs to the world cup and insist they must use equipment provided by the governing body.armbands are the latest battleground for players to push political messages linked to the world cup hosted in qatar, where homosexual acts are illegal and the treatment of migrant workers building projects for the tournament has been a decade-long controversy.“wearing the armband together on behalf of our teams will send a clear message when the world is watching,” england captain harry kane said in a statement.the swiss soccer federation said it wanted captain granit xhaka to wear an armband on which “you can see a heart with diverse colors which represent the diversity of humanity.”soccer players have embraced their platform to make statements in recent years. taking a knee on the field was routine before premier league games for two seasons after the death of george floyd, a black man killed by a police officer in the united states.fifa supported taking a knee and now has to decide whether to back some of its most influential member federations in a gesture that could embarrass qatar.“a request to fifa has also been submitted asking that permission be provided for the armbands to be worn throughout the fifa world cup,” the welsh soccer federation said in a statement.fifa did not immediately comment on the request.the armbands can be worn at uefa-organized games in the nations league this week, including by both captains when belgium hosts wales on thursday.the campaign for the armbands was launched one day after the emir of qatar spoke at the united nations general assembly in new york promising a world cup without discrimination.“the qatari people will receive with open arms football fans from all walks of life,” sheikh tamim bin hamad al-thani said in a speech to other world leaders.the eight european teams backing the “one love” campaign for human rights also included belgium and denmark. the five european qualifiers for the world cup not taking part wednesday were croatia, poland, portugal, serbia and spain.however, poland captain robert lewandowski — a two-time fifa world player of the year — said this week he would take an armband in the blue and yellow colors of ukraine’s flag to qatar.poland refused to play russia, the 2018 world cup host, in a playoff match in march. before the game, fifa and european soccer body uefa banned russian teams from international competitions because the country invaded ukraine.the campaign for the armbands emerged while a panel of uefa member federations monitored progress in qatar on labor law reforms and other human rights ahead of the tournament.that panel includes the norwegian soccer federation, whose president lise klaveness delivered a scathing criticism of the qatari project at an annual fifa meeting in march in doha on the eve of the tournament draw.england and wales were among the federations wednesday acknowledging progress made in qatar since the wealthy emirate won the world cup hosting vote in december 2010.however, the english federation said players would meet with some migrant workers who will be invited to its training camp in al wakrah.england also added to support already expressed in germany this week for fifa and world cup organizers to compensate the families of construction workers who came to qatar to help build stadiums, metro lines and hotels.amnesty international has suggested fifa should pay $440 million in reparations to equal the prize money being paid to the 32 teams in qatar.at a german federation event on monday, an invited fan who is gay used the platform to urge the qatari ambassador that his country should abolish laws against homosexuality. the ambassador, abdulla bin mohammed bin saud al thani, complained that human rights issues were distracting from the tournament.___more ap soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/ap_sportsby entering your

planned next week for former leader shinzo abe, officials and media reports said.the man, believed to be in his 70s, sustained burns on large parts of his body but was conscious and told police that he set himself on fire after pouring oil over himself, kyodo news agency reported.a note was found with him that said, “personally, i am absolutely against” abe’s funeral, kyodo reported.a tokyo fire department official confirmed that a man set himself afire on the street in tokyo’s kasumigaseki government district and that he was alive when he was taken to a hospital by ambulance, but declined to give further details, including the man’s identity, motive or condition, citing the sensitivity of what was a police matter.police called it an attempted suicide and refused to give further details because the case involved no criminal intent. police also declined to comment on a report that a police officer was caught in the fire.the incident underscores a growing wave of protests against the funeral for abe, who was one of the most divisive leaders in postwar japanese politics because of his revisionist view of wartime history, support for a stronger military, and what critics call an autocratic approach and cronyism. more protests are expected in coming days, including the day of the funeral next week.it also is an embarrassment for police, who have stepped up security for an event expected to be attended by about 6,000 people, including u.s. vice president kamala harris and other dignitaries.police were also partly blamed for insufficient protection of abe, who was shot to death by a gunman who approached him from behind as he was giving an outdoor campaign speech in july.prime minister fumio kishida is in new york for the annual u.n. general assembly meeting of world leaders. he gave a speech tuesday expressing disappointment over the security council’s failure to respond to the russian invasion of ukraine because of russia’s permanent veto and called for reforms that would allow the u.n. to better defend global peace and order.the planned state funeral for abe has become increasingly unpopular among japanese as more details emerge about the governing liberal democratic party’s and abe’s links to the unification church, which built close ties with party lawmakers over their shared interests in conservative causes.the suspect in abe’s assassination reportedly believed his mother’s large donations to the church ruined his family. the ldp has said nearly half its lawmakers have ties to the church, but party officials have denied ties between the party as an organization and the church.kishida has said abe deserves the honor of a state funeral as japan’s longest-serving post-world war ii leader and for his diplomatic and economic achievements.critics have said it was decided undemocratically and is an inappropriate and costly use of taxpayers’ money. they say kishida decided to hold a state funeral to please abe’s party faction and buttress his own power. support ratings for kishida’s government have weakened amid public dissatisfaction over his handling of the party’s church ties and the funeral plans.a family funeral for abe was held at a buddhist temple in july. the state funeral is scheduled for next tuesday at the budokan martial arts arena in tokyo.by entering your email and clicking sign up, you're

central mountain town of cayey, said maria left him without power for a year.“we paid an electrician out of our own pocket to connect us,” he recalled, adding that he doesn’t think the government will be of much help again after fiona.long lines were reported at several gas stations across puerto rico, and some pulled off a main highway to collect water from a stream.“we thought we had a bad

announced his death on monday without disclosing the cause or location.“his research helped prove that the human body is ready for flights not only to near-earth orbit, but also to deep space,” roscosmos wrote in a telegram post. “we express our deepest condolences to the relatives and friends of valery vladimirovich.”he was born valery ivanovich korshunov on april 27, 1942, but changed his name after being adopted in 1957, according to the new mexico museum of space history. polyakov began as a physician and joined the institute of biomedical problems in moscow in 1971, according to cnn.after undergoing spaceflight training to demonstrate he could administer assistance to fellow astronauts in orbit and passing his exams in 1972, polyakov became one of the first doctor-cosmonaut trainees in history. he earned his candidate of medical sciences degree in 1976.polyakov’s first lengthy space mission in 1988 lasted eight months, and he became deputy director of the institute he once joined as a young man upon returning back to earth. it was his second and final mission, however, that made history. now a specialist in the nascent field of space medicine, polyakov volunteered to prove human beings could withstand microgravity and reach mars, according to wired. his flight to dock with russia’s mir space station launched on jan. 8, 1994 — and polyakov didn’t return until march 22, 1995.polyakov orbited earth 7,075 times and traveled around 187 million miles during those 14 months — during which millions of people back on earth had marveled at the launch of the netscape navigator internet browser, the opening of the english channel tunnel and o.j. simpson’s high-speed police chase.according to “the story of manned space stations” by philip baker, american astronaut norman thagard said polyakov returned to earth “big and strong” and looked “like he could wrestle a bear.” polyakov exercised during his mission and refused assistance upon landing, opting to walk on his own.“when his capsule landed in kazakhstan he walked from it to a nearby chair, a tremendous achievement,” wrote baker. “he also stole a cigarette from a friend nearby, but could hardly be blamed for that. he sipped a small brandy and inwardly celebrated his mission.”while nasa astronauts scott kelly and mark vande hei respectively spent 340 and 355 consecutive days in space and peggy whitson spent 665 cumulative days in space, the consecutive 437-day stay accomplished by valery polyakov remains unprecedented.“his record still stands today,” wrote baker, “and it is unlikely to be broken until man ventures to mars.”trends reporterby entering your email and clicking sign up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising

“reboot” is a curious product of this particular cultural era. it follows the reboot of a fictional early 2000s family sitcom, “step right up,” and the tensions it places on its dysfunctional cast and crew.among the stars of the show (and show within a show) are keegan-michael key, judy greer and johnny knoxville, whose characters begrudgingly sign on for the reboot after many disappointing career and life changes since the original run. paul reiser — who was recently in a reboot of his own, with the 2019 revival of 1990s sitcom “mad about you” — and rachel bloom play gordon and hannah, the father-daughter team of showrunners behind the relaunch of “step right up.”premiering tuesday, the eight-episode series marks creator steven levitan’s first show since the long-running abc sitcom “modern family.” huffpost senior culture reporters marina fang and candice frederick discuss what they thought of “reboot” and assess where it fits into the larger cultural conversation on the topic.marina fang: all of us on the huffpost culture desk talk a lot about the seemingly never-ending stream of reboots, revivals, re-imaginings, etc., etc. — what i often like to joke is the “reboot industrial complex.” so the idea of a sitcom about a fictional reboot of a sitcom, involving a lot of people who’ve been part of major sitcoms before, definitely piqued my interest. candice, what did you think of “reboot,” and how well do you think it captures this cultural moment we’re in?candice frederick: yeah, the reboot industrial complex is real, and it’s exhausting. so, i went into “reboot” fearing it would be a bit navel-gazey and unnecessary.but i was struck by how much it delves into what it means to actually go forward with a reboot, the human impact of it. like, how the actors, who haven’t worked in forever — or who haven’t gotten the type of prestige work they thought would follow after the series — are ill-equipped to deal with the new celebrity industrial complex where media can be very vampiric with their personal questions, or what it means to bring a show from a certain period into present day.what’s to become of the original staff writers? can they write dialogue that pertains or contends with today’s culture? what does that look like when they have to share a writing room with younger writers? the generational questions were interesting to me.what did you think going into it?mf: absolutely, i had those exact same fears. but i think it finds the right balance in its meta jokes about the industry. for example, the show within a show, like the show itself, is being produced at hulu, and one of the characters is a fictionalized hulu executive. that was all very funny.once i started watching it, i found myself wishing it had a sharper point of view about the concept of reboots — a specific thing it was trying to say about it all. but then, when you and i were deciding to do this “should you watch it?” article, you mentioned everything you said above. and i realized you’re totally right, that this is what really makes this show interesting.in the larger cultural discussion around reboots, we don’t talk as much about what it means for the actors and writers to return to something they made 20 years ago, that probably hasn’t aged well, and how they’re probably in a very different place in their lives and careers when they decide to do these reboots. this show does a great job of exploring those dynamics.mf: the dynamic between bree and reed (greer and key) felt totally lived-in. like, i totally bought that they had a thing 20 years ago, and being together again is bringing up all kinds of messy feelings. i loved both of those performances, part of a really stacked cast on this show.candice, what did you think of the cast, and were there any really standout performances for you?cf: omg yes! loved that the comedy exec at hulu (krista marie yu) is hyperserious and actually knows nothing about comedy. i’m sure this happens a lot in the industry.to your point, though, it did stick out to me that the show doesn’t have a point of view about reboots — especially since you and i both definitely do! but i also wonder if these folks who decide to do a reboot actually have a point of view on that. some need the money. others need their careers reinvigorated. others, especially women like judy greer’s character, need to prove that they still have it and that the industry can’t send them out to pasture just yet. that was all very interesting to me.lol, judy and keegan are comedy gold, totally agree. you know who i also thought was quite interesting? alyah chanelle scott, who plays timberly, who’s kind of a plant from the reality tv show industrial complex. she parlayed that into a scripted tv career. but when she tries to prove herself, of course people like bree feel threatened. that was a totally unexpected storyline that actually made a lot of sense to me, and i think both women are very good there.what did you think of johnny knoxville and his character (who i admit i have never actually seen on anything before)? i intentionally avoided the whole “jackass” phenomenon.mf: yes, i liked how that all felt very real!i also have never watched any of the installments of the “jackass” franchise. i did like that his character seemed pretty reflective of a washed-up, middle-aged white dude — like, you can easily picture a real-life equivalent.cf: same! he is definitely a major source of comic relief but actually has gravitas. like a whole lot of these characters, he’s been sort of just ... floating since this tv show. so, we get to see him really wrangle with that as well.so, there’s a whole other section of the show that could have possibly been its own series, which is the relationship between rachel bloom’s and paul reiser’s characters, hannah and gordon. as a stand-alone character, i think gordon is actually more interesting as the returning showrunner who’s trying to navigate the new turf and having to partner with his daughter, hannah. hannah is the more unsure character, who’s still getting her feet wet. but we again see how these two generations can work together. mf: yeah, i liked seeing the writers room, which is another place where the show could have gotten a bit too navel-gazey, but it really works. gordon is used to doing things the old way: hiring all of his friends, writing a bunch of hacky, tired jokes, etc. meanwhile, hannah is trying to make a more substantive show and hire a more inclusive writers room. the way they are constantly at an impasse feels like a lot of what we see play out in real life.were there any other high points for you, or anything else you wanted to shout out? i think it’s safe to say we both liked it.cf: yes! the genuineness of their reactions really worked. like, that is exactly how i would imagine it would be.cf: i think one question that came to mind is whether this deserves another season. like, do we want more of this story? honestly, i’d watch. i think there is more story to mine here.mf: that’s a good question! like a lot of streaming series, these eight episodes tell a complete story but also leave just enough of an opening for another season. i could go either way. if they do pick it up for a second season, i’d watch it.cf: same! i’d like to know more about these people. somewhat related: did you ever watch the show “unreal”? i think this would make a good companion piece because of what they both say about the human impact of putting on what are ultimately scripted tv shows.mf: yes, i did watch and really liked “unreal,” until it went off the rails in its later seasons. there was also a short-lived fox show last year called “the big leap,” which is similar to “unreal” but the show within a show is a dance competition series — another possibility, if you’re reading this and want to check out more of these shows with meta qualities about tv. can we call them “russian doll shows”? lol.cf: haha i love that — and now i have to find “the big leap”! never even heard of it.mf: anyway, should you watch “reboot”? definitely.cf: and yes, i really like “reboot”! would recommend.senior culture

for the los angeles dodgers on three world series championship teams, has died. he was 89.wills died monday night at home in sedona, arizona, the team said tuesday after being informed by family members. no cause of death was given.wills played on world series title teams in 1959, ’63 and ’65 during his first eight seasons with the dodgers. he also played for pittsburgh and montreal before returning to the dodgers from 1969-72, when he retired.during his 14-year career, wills batted .281 with 2,134 hits and 586 stolen bases in 1,942 games.wills broke ty cobb’s single-season record for stolen bases with his 97th swipe on sept. 23, 1962. that season he became the first player to steal more than 100 bases.the dodgers will wear a patch in memory of wills for the rest of this season.“maury wills was one of the most exciting dodgers of all time,” team president and ceo stan kasten said. “he changed baseball with his base-running and made the stolen base an important part of the game. he was very instrumental in the success of the dodgers with three world championships.”wills had an ill-fated stint managing the seattle mariners from 1980-81, going 26-56 with a winning percentage of .317.he was the national league most valuable player in 1962, the same year he was mvp of the all-star game played in his hometown of washington, d.c.wills stayed at home with his family instead of at the team hotel for the all-star game. he arrived at the ballpark carrying a dodgers bag and wearing a dodgers shirt. however, the security guard wouldn’t let him in, saying he was too small to be a ballplayer.wills suggested the guard escort him to the nl clubhouse door, where he would wait while the guard asked the players to confirm his identity.“so we walk down there and baseball players have a sick sense of humor, because when i stood in front of the door, with my dodger shirt and duffel bag, and the man opened the door and said, ‘anybody in here know this boy?’ and they all looked at me and said, ’never saw him before,” wills told the washington post in 2015.after the game, wills left with his mvp trophy and showed it to the guard.“he still didn’t believe me, he thought maybe i was carrying it for somebody,” wills told the post.wills led the nl in stolen bases from 1960-65, was a seven-time all-star selection and won gold glove awards in 1961 and ’62.he was credited with reviving the stolen base as a strategy. his speed made him a constant threat on the basepaths and he distracted pitchers even if he didn’t try to steal. he carefully studied pitchers and their pickoff moves when he wasn’t on base. when a pitcher’s throw drove him back to the bag, he became even more determined to steal.once, in a game against the new york mets, wills was on first base when pitcher roger craig threw 12 straight times to the bag. on craig’s next throw, wills stole second.by age 32, wills was bandaging his legs before games because of the punishment of sliding.after retiring with the dodgers in 1972, wills worked an analyst at nbc for five years. he also managed winter ball in the mexican pacific league, winning a league championship in 1970-71.wills’ tenure managing the mariners was largely regarded as a disaster and he was criticized for his lack of managerial experience. it was evident in the numerous gaffes he committed, including calling for a relief pitcher when nobody was warming up in the bullpen and holding up a game for several minutes while looking for a pinch hitter.wills’ biggest mistake came on april 25, 1981, when he ordered the mariners’ ground crew to extend the batter’s box a foot longer toward the mound than regulation allowed. oakland manager billy martin noticed and asked home plate umpire bill kunkel to investigate.kunkel questioned the head groundskeeper, who admitted wills had ordered the change. wills said it was to help his players stay in the box. however, martin suspected it was to give the mariners an advantage against oakland’s breaking-ball pitchers. wills was suspended for two games by the american league and fined $500.wills led the mariners to a 20-38 record to end the 1980 season, and he was fired on may 6, 1981, when the team was mired in last place at 6-18. years later, wills admitted he probably should have gotten more experience as a minor league manager before being hired in the big leagues.wills struggled with addictions to alcohol and cocaine until getting sober in 1989. he credited dodgers pitching great don newcombe, who overcame his own alcohol problems, with helping him. newcombe died in 2109.“i’m standing here with the man who saved my life,” wills said of newcombe. “he was a channel for god’s love for me because he chased me all over los angeles trying to help me and i just couldn’t understand that. but he persevered, he wouldn’t give in and my life is wonderful today because of don newcombe.”born maurice morning wills in washington, d.c., on oct. 2, 1932, he was a three-sport standout at cardozo senior high. he earned all-city honors as a quarterback in football, in basketball and as a pitcher in baseball when he was nicknamed sonny.in 1948, he played on the school’s undefeated football team, which never gave up any points. on the mound, wills threw a one-hitter and struck out 17 in a game in 1950. the school’s baseball field is named in his honor.wills has his own museum in fargo, north dakota, where he was a coach and instructor for the fargo-moorhead redhawks from 1996-97.he is survived by wife carla, and children barry, micki, bump, anita, susan quam and wendi jo wills. bump was a former major league second baseman who played for texas and the chicago cubs.___more ap mlb: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and

voting this week to become integral parts of russia. the concerted and quickening kremlin-backed efforts to swallow up four regions could set the stage for moscow to escalate the war following ukrainian successes on the battlefield.the scheduling of referendums starting friday in the luhansk, kherson and partly russian-controlled zaporizhzhia and donetsk regions came after a close ally of russian president vladimir putin said the votes are needed and as moscow is losing ground in the invasion it began nearly seven months ago, increasing pressure on the kremlin for a stiff response.former president dmitry medvedev, the deputy head of russia’s security council chaired by putin, said referendums that fold regions into russia itself would make redrawn frontiers “irreversible” and enable moscow to use “any means” to defend them.ukrainian foreign minister dmytro kuleba denounced the votes as a sham and tweeted that “ukraine has every right to liberate its territories and will keep liberating them whatever russia has to say.”the votes, in territory russia already controls, are all but certain to go moscow’s way but are unlikely to be recognized by western governments who are backing ukraine with military and other support that has helped its forces seize momentum on battlefields in the east and south.in donetsk, part of ukraine’s wider donbas region that has been gripped by rebel fighting since 2014 and which putin has set as a primary objective of the invasion, separatist leader denis pushilin said the vote will “restore historic justice” to the territory’s “long-suffering people.”they “have earned the right to be part of the great country that they always considered their motherland,” he said.in partly russian-occupied zaporizhzhia, pro-russia activist vladimir rogov said: “the faster we become part of russia, the sooner peace will come.”pressure inside russia for votes and from moscow-backed leaders in ukrainian regions that moscow controls increased after a ukrainian counteroffensive — bolstered by western-supplied weaponry — that has recaptured large areas.former kremlin speechwriter and russian political analyst abbas gallyamov said on facebook that moscow-backed separatists appeared “scared that the russians will abandon them” amid the ukrainian offensive and forged ahead with referendum plans to force the kremlin’s hand.in another signal that russia is digging in for a protracted and possibly ramped-up conflict, the kremlin-controlled lower of house of parliament voted tuesday to toughen laws against desertion, surrender and looting by russian troops. lawmakers also voted to introduce possible 10-year prison terms for soldiers refusing to fight. if approved, as expected, by the upper house and then signed by putin, the legislation would strengthen commanders’ hands against failing morale reported among soldiers.kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said there are no prospects for a diplomatic settlement. medvedev, who served as russia’s president from 2008-2012, said on his messaging app channel that separatist region votes are important to protect their residents and would “completely change” russia’s future trajectory.“after they are held and the new territories are taken into russia’s fold, a geopolitical transformation of the world will become irreversible,” medvedev said.“an encroachment on the territory of russia is a crime that would warrant any means of self-defense,” he said, adding that russia would enshrine the new territories in its constitution so no future russian leader could hand them back.“that is why they fear those referendums so much in kyiv and in the west,” medvedev said. “that is why they must be held.”ukrainian analyst volodymyr fesenko, head of the independent penta center think-tank based in kyiv, said the kremlin hopes the votes and the possibility of military escalation will raise the pressure from western governments for ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy to start talks with moscow.the move “reflects the weakness, not the strength of the kremlin, which is struggling to find levers to influence the situation that has increasingly spun out of its control,” he said.the recapturing of territory, most notably in the northeastern kharkiv region, has strengthened ukraine’s arguments that its troops could deliver more stinging defeats to russia with additional armament deliveries.more heavy weaponry is on its way, with slovenia promising 28 tanks and germany pledging four additional self-propelled howitzers. more aid also is expected from britain, already one of ukraine’s biggest military backers after the u.s. british prime minister liz truss is expected to promise that in 2023, her government will “match or exceed” the 2.3 billion pounds ($2.7 billion) in military aid given to ukraine this year.the swiftness of the ukrainian counteroffensive also saw russian forces abandon armored vehicles and other weapons as they beat hasty retreats. ukrainian forces are recycling the captured weaponry back into battle. a washington-based think tank, the institute for the study of war, said abandoned russian t-72 tanks are being used by ukrainian forces seeking to push into russian-occupied luhansk.in the counteroffensive’s wake, ukrainian officials found hundreds of graves near the once-occupied city of izium. yevhenii yenin, a deputy minister in ukraine’s internal affairs ministry, told a national telecast that officials found many bodies “with signs of violent death.”“these are broken ribs and broken heads, men with bound hands, broken jaws and severed genitalia,” he said.meanwhile, ukraine’s southern military command said its troops sank a russian barge carrying troops and weapons across the dnieper river near the russian-occupied city of nova kakhovka. it offered no other details on the attack in the russian-occupied kherson region, which has been a major target in the ukrainian counteroffensive.in other developments:— ukraine’s presidential office said fresh shelling killed three civilians and injured 19 more in a 24-hour span.— moscow has likely moved its kilo-class submarines from their station on the crimean peninsula to southern russia over fears about them being struck by long-range ukrainian fire, the british military said.— mcdonald’s restaurants in kyiv began serving again for the first time since the invasion, offering only delivery service initially but marking a step of sorts back toward the life ukrainians knew before the war.___follow ap war

tuesday as a category 3 storm, prompting the government to impose a curfew.forecasters said fiona was expected to pass near grand turk, the british territory’s capital island, on tuesday morning.“storms are unpredictable,” premier washington misick said in a statement from london, where he was attending the funeral of queen elizabeth ii. “you must therefore take every precaution to ensure your safety.”misick is scheduled to return home on thursday.early tuesday, fiona was centered 20 miles (30 kilometers) southeast of grand turk island. it had maximum sustained winds of 115 mph (185 kph) and was moving north-northwest at 10 mph (17 kph).the intensifying storm kept dropping copious rain over the dominican republic and puerto rico, where a 58-year-old man died after police said he was swept away by a river in the central mountain town of comerio.another death was linked to a power blackout — a 70-year-old man was burned to death after he tried to fill his generator with gasoline while it was running, officials said.the national guard has rescued more than 900 people as floodwaters continue to rush through towns in eastern and southern puerto rico with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain forecast for some areas. multiple landslides also were reported.the blow from fiona was made more devastating because puerto rico has yet to recover from hurricane maria, which killed nearly 3,000 people and destroyed the power grid in 2017. five years later, more than 3,000 homes on the island are still covered by blue tarps.authorities said at least 1,300 people and some 250 pets remain in shelters across the island.fiona sparked a blackout when it hit puerto rico’s southwest corner on sunday, the anniversary of hurricane hugo, which slammed into the island in 1989 as a category 3 storm.by tuesday morning, authorities said they had restored power to more than 260,000 customers on the island of 3.2 million people.puerto rico gov. pedro pierluisi has warned it could take days before everyone has electricity.water service was cut to more than 837,000 customers — two thirds of the total on the island — because of turbid water at filtration plants or lack of power, officials said.fiona is not expected to threaten the u.s. mainland.in the dominican republic, authorities reported one death: a man hit by a falling tree. the storm displaced more than 12,400 people and cut off at least two communities.the hurricane left several highways blocked, and a tourist pier in the town of miches was badly damaged by high waves. at least four international airports were closed, officials said.the dominican president, luis abinader, said authorities would need several days to assess the storm’s effects.fiona previously battered the eastern caribbean, killing one man in the french territory of guadeloupe when floodwaters washed his home away, officials said.by entering your email and clicking sign up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized

off-air, the golden globe awards are returning to nbc in january, when the embattled hollywood foreign press association will seek a primetime comeback.nbc, the hollywood press association and dick clark productions on tuesday made the globes’ return official. the 80th golden globes will be held january 10, airing both on nbc and peacock.for the past year and half, hollywood has effectively boycotted the globes, for years one of the most-watched award shows after the academy awards. but after the los angeles times reported ahead of the 2021 broadcast that the hfpa’s 87 members of non-american journalists included no black members, studios, publicists and stars said they would cease participating in the globes. tom cruise returned his three golden globe awards.since then, the hfpa has reorganized itself, revamped its membership and enacted reforms designed to curtail the kinds of unethical behavior the group has long been criticized for. the hfpa added new members, including six black voting members, and recently added 103 international, nonmember voters. the hfpa on tuesday said their voting body is now 52% female, 19.5% latino, 12% asian, 10% black and 10% middle eastern.“we recognize the hfpa’s commitment to ongoing change and look forward to welcoming back the golden globes to nbc for its landmark 80th anniversary in january 2023,” said frances berwick, chairman of entertainment networks for nbcuniversal.nbc had reason to want to get the globes back on the air. in 2018, the network signed an eight-year deal to continue airing the awards through 2026. citing the hfpa’s ongoing reforms, nbc elected not to televise the previous golden globes in january. the organization went ahead announcing awards, anyway, in an untelevised and little-noticed gathering unattended by nominees.this year’s ceremony, the organizations said, will be broadcast in a one-year agreement. terms were unavailable but the deal is expected to be less than the approximately $60 million the network previously paid annually to air the globes. with backlash swirling and the ceremony scaled down because of the pandemic, the 2021 globes were watched by 6.9 million people, according to nielsen, down from more than 18 million the year before.whether nbc’s endorsement will be enough to return the globes to hollywood’s good graces, however, remains to be seen. nominations to the globes will be announced dec. 12.the hfpa is currently being run by interim chief executive todd boehly, whose investment firm, eldridge industries, bought the globes and turned it from a nonprofit into a for-profit venture. boehly’s firm is also the parent company of dick clark productions, the awards’ producer, and the owner of the globes’ longtime home, the beverly hilton.___follow ap film writer jake coyle on twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleapby entering your email and clicking sign up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages

territory said it was too early to estimate the damage from a storm that was still forecast to unleash torrential rain across puerto rico on monday.up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) was forecast for puerto rico’s eastern and southern regions.“it’s important people understand that this is not over,” said ernesto morales, a meteorologist with the national weather service in san juan.he said flooding has reached “historic levels,” with authorities evacuating or rescuing hundreds of people across the island.“the damages that we are seeing are catastrophic,” said gov. pedro pierluisi.brown water rushed through streets, into homes and even consumed a runway airport in southern puerto rico.fiona also ripped up asphalt from roads and washed away a bridge in the central mountain town of utuado that police say was installed by the national guard after hurricane maria hit in 2017 as a category 4 storm.the storm also ripped off the roofs of several homes, including that of nelson cirino in the northern coastal town of loiza.“i was sleeping and saw when the corrugated metal flew off,” he said as he observed how the rain drenched his belonging.ada vivian román, a 21-year-old photography student, said the storm knocked down trees and fences in her hometown of toa alta.“i’m actually very anxious because it’s a really slow-moving hurricane,” she said.she said she is also worried about whether the public transportation she relies on to get to her job at a public relations agency will be operating by the time she has to go back to the office.“but i know that i’m privileged compared with other families who are practically losing their homes because they are under water,” she said.fiona was centered 50 miles (85 kilometers) southeast of punta cana, dominican republic with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (140 kph) on sunday night, according to the u.s. national hurricane center. it was moving to the northwest at 9 mph (15 kph).it hit on the anniversary of hurricane hugo, which slammed into the island in 1989 as a category 3 storm.as authorities continue to assess the damage from fiona, many wondered when power would be restored.“that’s probably the worst damage there is,” said tomás rivera, who co-owns a hotel in the southwest coastal town of el combate.u.s. president joe biden declared a state of emergency in the u.s. territory as the eye of the storm approached the island’s southwest corner.the blackout that hurricane maria caused was blamed for the deaths of nearly 3,000 people in the storm’s sweltering aftermath, with power in some neighborhoods not restored until a year later. maria was a devastating category 4 storm that struck on sept. 20, 2017.impressive convective burst within hurricane fiona's eye wall, just as it comes ashore in puerto rico. pic.twitter.com/yb5k6qec3kluma, the company that operates power transmission and distribution, said bad weather, including winds of 80 mph, had disrupted transmission lines on sunday, leading to “a blackout on all the island.”health centers were running on generators — and some of those had failed. health secretary carlos mellado said crews rushed to repair generators at the comprehensive cancer center, where several patients had to be evacuated.more than 3,000 homes still have only a blue tarp as a roof, and infrastructure remains weak, including the power grid. outages remain common, and reconstruction started only recently.“i think all of us puerto ricans who lived through maria have that post-traumatic stress of, ‘what is going to happen, how long is it going to last and what needs might we face?’” said danny hernández, who works in the capital of san juan but planned to weather the storm with his parents and family in the western town of mayaguez.the entire island of puerto rico was without power as hurricane fiona made landfall and threatened to cause 'catastrophic flooding' and landslides https://t.co/mplmume5ne pic.twitter.com/brr7nfdgctthe storm pummeled cities and towns along puerto rico’s southern coast that have not yet fully recovered from a string of strong earthquakes starting in late 2019.more than 1,000 people with some 80 pets had sought shelter across the island by sunday night, the majority of them in the southern coast.fiona was forecast to swipe the dominican republic early monday and then northern haiti and the turks and caicos islands with the threat of heavy rain. it could threaten the far southern end of the bahamas on tuesday.hurricane warnings were posted for the dominican republic’s eastern coast from cabo caucedo to cabo frances viejo, and for the turks and caicos.fiona previously battered the eastern caribbean, killing one man in the french territory of guadeloupe

fear that ukraine may become an economic basket case, even if it wins the war. or that the world may forget the country’s plight altogether.ukrainans, their friends and those simply curious about the country that’s fought russia to standstill gathered on a sun-splashed weekend at st. andrew ukrainian orthodox cathedral in suburban washington for the region’s biggest annual ukrainian cultural festival.amid women wearing garlands in their hair, men wearing vyshyvanka — white shirts with intricately patterned embroidery down the front — and accompanied by traditional and pop ukrainian music, the war was never far from people’s minds. what in past years had been a chance to showcase the culture and drink some beers from the home country had taken on a different, somewhat deeper meaning.“this year is particularly beautiful and sad at the same time,” said the church pastor, the rev. volodymr steliac, as he formally opened the festival saturday. “we have seen the worst of humanity but at the same time we have seen the best of humanity.” the festival opened on day 206 of the invasion and came amid good news for ukraine: a surprise counteroffensive in the northeast that in a few days cleared russians from towns and villages they had fought weeks to take earlier in the war.but the victory came with a price. in the strategic town of izium, mass graves were found, similar to those seen in the capital kyiv’s suburb of bucha when the war began.“we have seen the worst of humanity but at the same time we have seen the best of humanity.”oksana sukhina, who was staffing the booth of the u.s. ukraine foundation, where she is project director, said she wanted to see what the impact of the latest reports of atrocities will be on europe.in the past, she said, some people suspected ukrainians have exaggerated the cruelty of the russians with reports of horrific claims like rape as a weapon of war and the theft of household goods then shipped to russia.“then you see bucha, you see now izyum. and we have yet to see kherson and mariupol and other places,” sukhina said.sukhina, 50, immigrated to the u.s. from kyiv in 2020. warned by former colleagues in the state department about the likelihood of invasion, her parents arrived in washington only days before the war.but as the prospect of kyiv’s being captured receded, they went back, as did one of her daughters. they joined a 23-year-old son who left his it job in chicago in march to help deliver food and medical supplies in kyiv.sukhina said she tried to convince him to stay, but could not forbid him to leave because she had participated in pro-democracy protests in 2004 and 2014.“i’m proud of them. they are trying to do whatever they can. and this is what makes us win,” she said.steliac said the church was open 24-7 when the war began. he was only getting two or three hours of sleep a night as volunteers dropped off humanitarian aid, organized it and shipped it to ukraine.in one 48-hour period, he said, two of those young volunteers lost their fathers back in ukraine.“the war is not there alone; the war is here as well,” steliac said. even though the process of gathering and sending aid has become more routine, even keeping in touch with family back home, he said, can be painful.“what was traumatic was that they were communicating with their relatives and they said, ‘oh, a bomb fell just a couple of neighborhoods over’ and then they tried to connect again and the phone connection doesn’t go through,” steliac said.“you think of the worst.”alex naumovych, a 36-year old mortgage loan officer from ternopil in the western part of ukraine, said he’s had calls interrupted by the air raid sirens, although now he said the alarms are likely to be ignored.ternopil, a city of about 250,000, has no military targets, but he said his parents still hear the sirens daily. ukraine tracks incoming missiles and activates local warning systems based on where they could potentially land, so even residents of cities not targeted are warned.“i’m worried that, sooner or later, one of those missiles may hit my city, like my parents’ place,” naumovych said.naumovych arrived in the u.s. almost 11 years ago. he had about $440 to his name then, he said, and started a landscaping business he sold years later for more than $1 million.“i’m worried that, sooner or later, one of those missiles may hit my city, like my parents’ place.”“i love this country. like you can come with $400 and six, seven years later you can be a millionaire,” he said.one of his big worries for ukraine now is its economy, with so many people out of work because of the war and inflation projected to hit 30%.“the economy is in bad shape,” naumovych said. “a lot of people left ukraine and i’m not sure they’re coming back”the parents of software engineer serhiy vorobiov, 43, are near the war’s front line in zaporizhzhya, a russian-speaking region that includes europe’s largest nuclear power plant. russia has captured the plant and ukrainians and others fear they will use it for blackmail.but vorobiov said his parents, only 25 miles from the front lines in the city of zaporizhzhya, still think everything is relatively safe. he said he chats with them with about the same frequency as before the war.“maybe because there is no very high emergency at this point. i know it’s not to my defense, but that’s how it is,” he said.vorobiov, his wife oksana, 33, and their three young children, yaromyr, myroslava and oksana, have lived in the u.s. since 2020. he said the war has reinforced his belief in getting rid of any russian influence on their upbringing.“i always dreamed of it, i just didn’t want to be very tough in that. but now i have all the rights and i want to use it,” vorobiov said.“i want them to forget [the] russian language. we are from [the] russian-speaking part of ukraine, but now we are fixing it, as much as we can. forget russian, forget we were ever together, [forget] soviet union. i’m happy they don’t know what soviet union is.” but in her remarks to open the festivities, oksana markarova, the ukrainian ambassador to the united states, advised focusing on the present, not the past.“please be joyful today,” she counseled.she said russian leader vladimir putin and the russians want ukrainians to “sit down and cry” at the devastation.“this is what russians want us to do. and we will not give it to them.”politics reporter, huffpost do you have information you want to share with huffpost? here’s how.by entering your email and clicking sign up,

by the united states was also freed and returned to kabul.mark frerichs, a navy veteran who had spent more than a decade in afghanistan as a civilian contractor, was abducted in january 2020 and was believed to have been since then by the taliban-linked haqqani network.negotiations for his release had centered on a deal that would also involve the release of bashir noorzai, a notorious drug lord and member of the taliban who told reporters in kabul on monday that he spent 17 years and six months in u.s. captivitythe biden administration did not immediately confirm details of the prisoner swap, but a sister of frerichs, who is from lombard, illinois, thanked u.s. government officials who helped secure her brother’s release.“i am so happy to hear that my brother is safe and on his way home to us. our family has prayed for this each day of the more than 31 months he has been a hostage. we never gave up hope that he would survive and come home safely to us,” said a statement from the sister, charlene cakora.in afghanistan, noorzai told reporters at a press conference that he had been released from an unspecified u.s. prison and handed over earlier in the day to the taliban in kabul, in exchange for an american prisoner held in afghanistan whom he did not identify.other taliban officials claimed noorzai was held at the u.s. detention facility at guantanamo bay, but did not offer say anything to support that claim.the taliban-appointed foreign minister, amir khan muttaqi, also spoke at the press conference alongside noorzai and welcomed the exchange, saying it marked the start of a “new era” in u.s.-taliban relations.frerichs, abducted on jan. 31, 2020, was last seen in a video distributed earlier this year, pleading for his release so that he can be reunited with his family, according to a recording posted by the new yorker magazine at the time.“this can be a new chapter between afghanistan and the united states, this can open a new door for talks between both countries,” muttaqi said at the kabul presser.“this act shows us that all problems can be solved through talks and i thank both sides’ teams who worked so hard for this to happen,” muttaqi added.frerichs, of lombard, illinois, was believed to be held by the taliban-affiliated haqqani network, and u.s. officials across two presidential administrations had tried unsuccessfully to get him home. in the video, which marked the first time frerichs was seen since his abduction, he says it was filmed last november.videos of hostages are sometimes released to show proof that they are alive and to facilitate negotiations for a release, though it was not immediately clear if that was the case here. the new yorker said it obtained the clip from an unidentified individual in afghanistan.at the time, the fbi declined to comment on the video’s authenticity, but a sister of frerichs, charlene cakora, issued a statement thanking the taliban for releasing the video and describing it as “public confirmation of our family’s long-held belief that he is alive after more than two years in captivity.”since their takeover of afghanistan in august last year, the taliban have demanded the united states release noorzai in exchange for frerichs amid expectations of such exchanges for u.s. citizens held in afghanistan.however, there has been no public sign of washington moving forward on any sort of prisoner trade or exchange.the taliban also posted a brief video monday on social media showing noorzai’s arrival at the kabul airport where he was welcomed by top taliban officials, including muttaqi.at the press conference, noorzai expressed thankfulness at seeing his “mujahedeen brothers” — a reference to the taliban — in kabul.“i pray for more success of the taliban,” he added. “i hope this exchange can lead to peace between afghanistan and america, because an american was released and i am also free now.”___faiez reported from islamabad.by entering your email and

(ap) — las vegas never had a professional sports champion — until sunday.chelsea gray scored 20 points to lead the las vegas aces to their first wnba title, and the city’s first pro title, in a 78-71 road win over the connecticut sun in game 4.gray went 9 of 13 from the floor, and was named finals mvp after averaging 18.3 points in the series.vegas finished on an 8-0 run. as the buzzer sounded, league mvp a’ja wilson, who played every minute of the game, grabbed the ball and stomped the floor before being mobbed by her teammates.“we champs! we champs! we champs!” wilson screamed at teammates as they pulled on their championship hats and t-shirts before the trophy ceremony.riquna williams had 17 points for vegas, kelsey plum added 16 points, jackie young had 13 and wilson added 11 points to go with her 14 rebounds.wilson hopes this is just the beginning for the franchise.“you see it. you see it,” wilson said in the on-court celebration. “this is what we’re building. this is what we’re doing. this is it. i’m so happy right now.”courtney williams had 17 points to lead connecticut and alyssa thomas had her second straight triple-double with 11 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds. jonquel jones added 13 points and dewanna bonner had 12.“when you come up short it certainly, really hurts,” sun coach curt miller said. “but that means that there was something that mattered, and something special among that group of players.”for aces coach becky hammon, who didn’t get a title in her standout wnba career, the ring completed a decades-long quest. she left an assistant coach position with gregg popovich and the san antonio spurs to take over in las vegas. the move paid off.“they’re unbelievable on the court, but they’re unbelievable humans, first and foremost,” hammon said. “they care about each other. they invest in each other. it’s been an absolute honor to be their coach. i saw excellence and i wanted to be a part of it.”hammon also paid tribute to former aces coach bill laimbeer, who was on the floor for the ceremony: “he put this team together and saw the pieces.”the las vegas aces are the 𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟮 𝗪𝗡𝗕𝗔 𝗖𝗛𝗔𝗠𝗣𝗜𝗢𝗡𝗦 🏆#raisethestakes

fourth when plum was called for a flagrant foul after running into bonner while the sun guard was attempting a 3-pointer and sending her to the floor holding her right ankle.bonner hit all three free throws before jones’ short jumper cut the lead to a point. the sun then tied the game at 67 on free throw by courtney williams and took a 71-70 lead on two fouls shots from brionna jones.but las vegas had the answers.riquna williams 3-pointer put the aces back on top and gray’s step-back jumper extended the lead back to 75-71 with under a minute left. a’ja wilson then stole a pass and plum hit a short jump shot to secure the win.the las vegas aces are bringing home the first major professional title in the city's history ♠️pic.twitter.com/1xm2xwgbcuas expected, it was a physical game — appropriately played on an nfl sunday. the sun got a scare when bonner took an inadvertent elbow to the gut from gray late in the first quarter and was on the floor for a few minutes before being helped to the bench. she came back into the game later in the half, apparently suffering no ill effects. natisha hiedeman and plum got into a short pushing match in the second quarter, eliciting technical fouls for both players. that was all before plum’s flagrant in the fourth.gray wasn’t a wnba all-star this season, nor was she a first-team all-league pick, and had voiced her displeasure about that. after scoring 21 points in each of the first two games of the finals, she scored just 11 points in game 3, but bounced back. way back.“they can keep that all-star and first team,” gray said. “i got the ring.”before the game, both coaches reflected on the makeup of organizations in the final. the aces are led by hammon and two black women executives in general manager natalie williams and nikki fargas, president of business operations. the sun are owned by the mohegan tribe, have a woman president in jen rizzotti and are coached by curt miller, a gay man.“women’s basketball is such a story in terms of diversity and inclusion. i mean, our league defines it and i’m so proud to be a part of it,” miller said, adding that he hopes to be an inspiration to any gay child “wondering if they can chase a career in sports.”hammon said she believes the diversity in her team’s front office has made it stronger.“you can make a lot better picture with a box full of

respects at queen elizabeth ii’s coffin on sunday as thousands of police, hundreds of british troops and an army of officials made final preparations for the queen’s state funeral — a spectacular display of national mourning that will also be the biggest gathering of world leaders for years.people across britain paused for a minute of silence at 8 p.m. in memory of the only monarch most have ever known. at westminster hall, where the queen is lying in state, the constant stream of mourners paused for 60 seconds as people observed the minute of reflection in deep silence.in windsor, where the queen will be laid to rest on monday after her funeral at westminster abbey, rain began to fall as the crowd fell silent for the moment of reflection. the rain stopped as the crowd erupted in applause.biden and first lady jill biden were among thousands of mourners — from locals and tourists to royals and world leaders — to pay their respects. the president made the sign of the cross and put his hand to his heart as he stood quietly near the casket in the ornate 900-year-old hall with his wife and u.s. ambassador jane hartley.biden then signed the official condolence book and attended a reception sunday at buckingham palace hosted by king charles iii. he is one of 500 world leaders and royals invited to the queen’s state funeral monday, along with hundreds of dignitaries, politicians, military veterans and british charity workers.biden called queen elizabeth ii “decent” and “honorable” and “all about service” as he signed the condolence book, saying his heart went out to the royal family.“queen elizabeth lived her life for the people,” jill biden wrote in a book for spouses and ambassadors. “she served with wisdom and grace. we will never forget her warmth, kindness and the conversations we shared.”as the dignitaries poured in, the clock was ticking down for those seeking a place in the longest queue many have ever seen to file past the queen’s coffin. the miles-long queue is expected to be closed to new arrivals later sunday so that everyone now in the line can view the coffin before monday morning, when it will be taken to westminster abbey for the queen’s funeral.family by family, thousands of people kept joining the line around the clock, braving chilly overnight temperatures and waits of up to 17 hours in a queue that stretched for over 5 miles (8 kilometers).lauren wilson, 36, was in the much-shorter queue for people with mobility issues. she said she wanted to experience in person the coffin lying in state.“the world is in such a weird place and then this happened. it feels more momentous,” she said.she worried that the pageantry surrounding elizabeth’s death deprives the queen’s relatives of the ability to come to terms with their loss.“the family are not allowed to grieve. i find it quite heartbreaking,” she said.the queen’s eight grandchildren, led by heir to the throne prince william, circled the coffin and stood with their heads bowed during a silent vigil on saturday evening.among the foreign leaders in london was new zealand prime minister jacinda ardern, who told the bbc she was humbled to represent her nation at the funeral and to witness the national outpouring of grief and respect for the late queen.“the thing that i will take away from this period is just the beauty of the public’s response, the kindness that you see from members of the public, the patience, the camaraderie. that has been, for me, the most moving tribute of all, has been the public response of the british people,” she said.people across the u.k. will also pause sunday evening for a nationwide minute of silence to remember the queen, who died sept. 8 at 96 after 70 years on the throne. monday has been declared a public holiday, and the funeral will be broadcast to a huge television audience worldwide and screened to crowds in parks and public spaces across the country.police officers from around the country will be on duty as part of the biggest one-day policing operation in london’s history.crowds also gathered sunday near windsor castle, where the queen will be laid to rest at a private family ceremony on monday evening.steve beeson came with his family of three and a bouquet of flowers he had purchased for the queen.“she has been a constant steadying of the reins for the country through all of these really rough times, the least we can do is come and say ‘thank you,’” he said.camilla, the queen consort, paid tribute to her mother-in-law in a video message, saying the monarch “carved her own role” as a “solitary woman” on a world stage dominated by men.“i will always remember her smile. that smile is unforgettable,” said camilla, who is married to charles.ukraine’s first lady, olena zelenska, was also among mourners paying respects to the queen’s coffin. british royal officials said zelenska met with catherine, the princess of wales, at buckingham palace on sunday afternoon. they did not release further details. the british government has been among the strongest supporters of ukraine since it was invaded by russia in february.on saturday night, it was the grandchildren’s time to mourn. william and prince harry, charles’ sons, were joined by princess anne’s children, zara tindall and peter philips; prince andrew’s daughters, princess beatrice and princess eugenie; and prince edward’s two children — lady louise windsor and james, viscount severn.william stood with his head bowed at the head of the coffin and harry at the foot. both princes, who are military veterans, were in uniform. the crowd kept slowly, silently filing past.“you could see that they were thinking hard about their grandmother, the queen,” said ian mockett, a civil engineer from oxford in southern england. “it was good to see them all together as a set of grandchildren, given the things that have happened over the last few years.”the lying-in-state continues until early monday morning, when the queen’s coffin will be moved on a gun carriage pulled by 142 royal navy sailors to nearby westminster abbey for the funeral, the finale of 10 days of national mourning for britain’s longest-reigning monarch.after the service monday at the abbey, the late queen’s coffin will be transported through the historic heart of london on the state gun carriage. it will then be taken in a hearse to windsor, where the queen will be interred alongside her late husband, prince philip, who died last year at 99.sumita tanda put down bright red roses as a huge floral tribute bloomed near windsor castle.“i feel so privileged to be a local resident of windsor,” she said. “i just wanted to pay my respects.”___follow ap coverage of queen elizabeth ii at

“avatar” during the creation of the 2009 blockbuster film.cameron, whose epic adventure movie is the highest-grossing film of all time, told the new york times on friday that the creative process behind the film didn’t come without a fight.cameron — who did not refer to the studio by name — said studio executives thought the epic film “should be shorter” and characters were flying around too much on banshee creatures.“well, it turns out that’s what the audience loved the most, in terms of our exit polling and data gathering,” cameron recalled.“and that’s a place where i just drew a line in the sand and said, ‘you know what? i made “titanic.” this building that we’re meeting in right now, this new half-billion dollar complex on your lot? “titanic” paid for that, so i get to do this.’”the director, who told the times that “avatar” is “still competitive with everything that’s out there these days,” claimed the studio later thanked him for his pushback.“i feel that my job is to protect their investment, often against their own judgment,” cameron said. “but as long as i protect their investment, all is forgiven.”cameron’s reflections on the blockbuster arrived roughly three months before the scheduled release of its sequel — “avatar: the way of water” — on dec. 16.the sequel arrives 13 years after the original film, a wait that cameron said once left him a “little concerned” ahead of december.“i was a little concerned that i had stretched the tether too far, in our fast-paced, modern world ...

(ap) — u.s. president joe biden, in london for the funeral of queen elizabeth ii, said sunday his heart went out to the royal family, adding the queen’s death left a “giant hole.”“it’s a loss that leaves a giant hole and sometimes you think you’ll never overcome it,” said biden, who often talks in very personal terms about loss following the death of his first wife and young daughter and later, his adult son.the president and first lady jill biden have kept a low profile since landing in the united kingdom. they traveled to westminster hall to pay their respects along with hundreds of thousands of mourners who waited more than 14 hours to walk past the queen’s casket.biden and the first lady then went to lancaster house to sign the condolence book before heading to buckingham palace for a reception hosted by king charles iii.the president spoke briefly after he signed the condolence book. “as i’ve told the king, she’s going to be with him every step of the way,” biden said. “you were fortunate to have had her for 70 years. we all were.”he said her reign was about “treating people with dignity.”“i talk about how my mother and father thought that everyone, no matter who they were … no matter where they’re from, deserved to be treated with dignity,” the president said. “and that’s exactly what she communicated. just the way she walked by her staff, just the way that she acted.”biden wrote in the book that “queen elizabeth was admired around the world for her unwavering commitment to service.”the first lady signed a condolence book for spouses and ambassadors, writing “queen elizabeth lived her life for the people. she served with wisdom and grace. we will never forget her warmth, kindness and the conversations we shared.”the president also said elizabeth modeled a sense of service.“there’s something within our capacity to do that can make things, not just the world better, but your neighborhood better, your household better, your workplace better,” he said. “that’s what she communicated to me anyway. it was an honor to meet her, an honor to meet her.”the president will return to the u.s. on monday and head to new york for the u.n. general assembly, where he’s to gather with prime minister liz truss, who had just taken over as the queen died.more than 2,000 people were expected at westminster abbey on monday for the state

didn’t have their work redone fully, weren’t fired in a timely manner and in some cases even received bonuses, according to the u.s. commerce department’s watchdog group.the findings released friday by the office of inspector general raise concerns about possible damage to the quality of the once-a-decade head count that determines political power and federal funding,off-campus students at colleges and universities were likely undercounted since the census started around the same time students were sent home to stop the spread of covid-19 in march 2020, the review found.during the 2020 census, the associated press documented cases of census takers who were pressured by their supervisors to enter false information into a computer system about homes they had not visited so they could close cases during the waning days of the census.supervisors were able to track their census takers’ work in real time through mobile devices that the census takers used to record information about households’ numbers, demographic characteristics and members’ relationships to one another. as a result, supervisors would get alerts when actions raised red flags about accuracy, such as a census taker recording data on a home while far away from the address or a census taker conducting an interview in just a few minutes. as a quality control check, others census takers were sent back to homes to re-interview residents.the inspector general’s probe concluded that some alerts weren’t being properly resolved, some re-interviews weren’t properly conducted and that the work of some census takers whose work had been flagged for falsifying data had not been reworked to fix its accuracy. in fact, some census takers whose work was flagged for falsifications were given more cases, weren’t fired and were reassigned to other operations, the report said.of the 1,400 census takers who were designated “hard fails” because questions about the accuracy of their work, only 300 were fired for misconduct or unsatisfactory performance. of the 1,400 “hard fail” census takers, 1,300 of them received bonuses ranging from $50 to $1,600 each, the report said.the census is the largest nonmilitary mobilization in the u.s. data gathered during the census determines how many congressional seats each state gets. the numbers also are used for redrawing political districts and distributing $1.5 trillion in federal spending each year. because of that, undercounts can cost communities funding.the 2020 census faced unprecedented challenges including the pandemic, natural disasters and political interference from the trump administration.“as a result, we asserted that the findings could not and should not be presented as a conclusive assessment of overall census quality.”in response to the inspector general’s report, the census bureau said it appreciated the concerns that were raised but disagreed with the conclusions that data quality may have been damaged since the report cited only a small number of cases out of the overall workload.“as a result, we asserted that the findings could not and should not be presented as a conclusive assessment of overall census quality,” census bureau director robert santos said in the written response.under census bureau rules, college and university students should have been counted where they spent the most time, either at on-campus housing or off-campus apartments, even if they were sent home because of the pandemic. most schools didn’t provide the census bureau with off-campus student data, and the bureau had to use a last-resort, less-accurate statistical tool to fill in the information gaps on more than 10% of the off-campus student population when they were given the information, the inspector general’s report said.schools often didn’t provide the data because they didn’t information on off-campus students or because of privacy concerns. the inspector general recommends passage of legislation that would require schools to provide needed information in future head counts.“although difficult to quantify, the fiscal implication of specifically undercounting off-campus students at the correct location for states and localities is potentially far-reaching,” the report said.the city of boston, which is home to northeastern university, boston university and several other schools, said in a challenge to its census figures that the count missed 6,000 students.by entering your email and clicking sign up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners. you

launches on monday to coincide with climate talks taking place at the united nations general assembly in new york.the global registry of fossil fuels includes data from over 50,000 oil, gas and coal fields in 89 countries. that covers 75% of global reserves, production and emissions, and is available for public use, a first for a collection of this size.until now there has been private data available for purchase, and analysis of the world’s fossil fuel usage and reserves. the international energy agency also maintains public data on oil, gas and coal, but it focuses on the demand for those fossil fuels, whereas this new database looks at what is yet to be burned.the registry was developed by carbon tracker, a nonprofit think tank that researches the energy transition’s effect on financial markets, and the global energy monitor, an organization that tracks a variety of energy projects around the globe.corporations, investors and scientists already have some level of access to private data on fossil fuels. mark campanale, founder of carbon tracker, said he hopes the registry will empower groups to hold governments accountable, for example, when they issue licenses for fossil fuel extraction.“civil society groups have got to get more of a focus on what governments are planning to do in terms of license issuance, both for coal and oil and gas, and actually begin to challenge this permitting process,” campanale told the associated press.the release of the database and an accompanying analysis of the collected data coincide with two critical sets of climate talks at the international level — the u.n. general assembly in new york beginning on september 13, and cop27 in sharm el sheikh, egypt, in november. data like what’s being released in the registry could arm environmental and climate groups to pressure national leaders to agree to stronger policies that result in less carbon emissions.and we’re in dire need of carbon reductions, campanale said.in their analysis of the data, the developers found that the united states and russia have enough fossil fuel still underground untapped to exhaust the world’s remaining carbon budget. that’s the remaining carbon the world can afford to emit before a certain amount of warming occurs, in this case 1.5 degrees celsius. it also shows these reserves would generate 3.5 trillion tons of greenhouse gas emissions, which is more than all of the emissions produced since the industrial revolution.“we already have enough extractable fossil fuels to cook the planet. we can’t afford to use them all — or almost any of them at this point. we’ve run out of time to build new things in old ways,” said rob jackson, a stanford university climate scientist who was not involved with the database.“i like the emphasis on transparency in fossil fuel production and reserves, down to specific projects. that’s a unique aspect to the work.”jackson compared the global carbon budget to a bathtub.“you can run water only so long before the tub overflows,” he said. when the tub is close to overflowing, he said, governments can turn down the faucet (mitigating greenhouse gas emissions) or open the tub’s drain more (removing carbon from the atmosphere).the database shows that we have much more carbon than we need as a global community, campanale said, and more than enough to overflow the bathtub and flood the bathroom in jackson’s analogy. so investors and shareholders should be holding decision makers at the world’s largest oil, gas and coal companies accountable when they approve new investments in fossil fuel extraction, he said.campanale said the hope is the investment community, “who ultimately own these corporations,” will use the data to begin to challenge the investment plans of companies still planning to expand oil, gas and coal projects.“companies like shell and exxon, chevron and their shareholders can use the analysis to to really begin to try and push the companies to move in a completely different direction.”___the associated press health and science department receives support from the howard hughes medical institute’s department of science education. the ap is solely

alaska’s vast and sparsely populated western coast braced friday for a powerful storm that forecasters said could be one of the worst in recent history, threatening hurricane-force winds and high surf that could knock out power and cause flooding.the storm is the remnants of what was typhoon merbok, which university of alaska fairbanks climate specialist rick thoman said is also influencing weather patterns far from alaska — a rare late-summer storm now is expected to bring rain this weekend to drought-stricken parts of california.“all this warm air that’s been brought north by this ex-typhoon is basically inducing a chain reaction in the jet stream downstream from alaska,” he said.“it’s a historic-level storm,” thoman said of the system steaming toward alaska. “in 10 years, people will be referring to the september 2022 storm as a benchmark storm.”hurricane-force winds were forecast in parts of the bering sea, while in the small communities of elim and koyuk, around 90 miles (145 kilometers) from the hub community of nome, water levels could be up to 18 feet (5 meters) above the normal high tide line, according to the national weather service. flood warnings were in effect until monday in parts of northwest alaska.in nome, which has about 3,500 residents, leon boardway was working as usual friday at the nome visitors center, a half-block from the bering sea. “i just want to keep my door open and the coffee pot on,” he said after it had begun to rain and the winds picked up.but few people were coming by. residents, visitors and businesses in the town, famous for being at the end of the iditarod trail sled dog race and the setting for the dredging-for-gold reality show “bering sea gold,” were boarding up windows and otherwise bracing for the storm.“the ocean is getting worse out there,” said boardway, 71, as he checked out the center’s webcam, which from its high perch has a good view of the swells.“i hope everybody stays calm and everybody just gets in a good, safe position,” he said.typhoon merbok formed farther east in the pacific ocean than where such storms typically appear. water temperatures are unusually warm this year so the storm “was able to spin up,” thoman said.meanwhile, a low-pressure system was expected to drop from the gulf of alaska and park off the coast of northern california, producing gusty ridgetop winds before rains set in late saturday, the national weather service said.in the sierra nevada foothills northeast of the state capital of sacramento, fire crews have been fighting what has become the largest wildfire in that state so far this year. while rain is needed, the storm was predicted to also bring winds that could spread the mosquito fire.the storm will slow but not end california’s fire season because fuels are critically dry and a period of warmer, drier weather will follow, said courtney carpenter, a national weather service meteorologist.forecasters said the weather system will spread rain down the state’s central coast but little if any is expected in most of southern california, where mountain and desert communities are dealing with the aftermath of too much rain.crews were clearing head-high mud flows in the san bernardino mountains east of los angeles, following flash-flooding monday. downpours from remnants of a pacific hurricane caused the devastation in southern california, with winds topping 100 mph (160 kph) last weekend.first responders on thursday found the body of a woman missing since the mudslides tore through her mountain town. her remains were discovered buried under mud,

this summer, as doctors and medical workers on the ground race to battle outbreaks of waterborne and other diseases. the floodwaters started receding this week in the worst-hit provinces but many of the displaced — now living in tents and makeshift camps — increasingly face the threat of gastrointestinal infections, dengue fever and malaria, which are on the rise. the dirty and stagnant waters have become breeding grounds for mosquitos. the unprecedented monsoon rains since mid-june, which many experts link to climate change, and subsequent flooding have killed 1,545 people across pakistan, inundated millions of acres of land and affected 33 million people. as many as 552 children have also been killed in the floods. “i am deeply concerned about the potential for a second disaster in pakistan: a wave of disease and death following this catastrophe, linked to climate change, that has severely impacted vital health systems leaving millions vulnerable,\" who's director-general, tedros adhanom ghebreyesus, said in a statement. “the water supply is disrupted, forcing people to drink unsafe water,\" he said. “but if we act quickly to protect health and deliver essential health services, we can significantly reduce the impact of this impending crisis.\"the who chief also said that nearly 2,000 health facilities have been fully or partially damaged in pakistan and urged donors to continue to respond generously so that more lives can be saved. pakistani prime minister shahbaz sharif left for new york on saturday to attend the first fully in-person gathering of world leaders at the u.n. general assembly since the coronavirus pandemic. sharif will appeal for more help from the international community to tackle the disaster. before his departure, sharif urged philanthropists and aid agencies to donate baby food for children, along with blankets, clothes and other food items for the flood victims, saying they were desperately waiting for aid.the southern sindh and southwestern baluchistan provinces have been the worst hit — hundreds of thousands in sindh live now in makeshift homes and authorities say it will take months to completely drain the water in the province. nationwide, floods have damaged 1.8 million homes, washed away roads and destroyed nearly 400 bridges, according to the national disaster management authority. imran baluch, head of a government-run district hospital in jafferabad, in the district of dera allah yar in baluchistan, said that out of 300 people tested daily, nearly 70% are positive for malaria. after malaria, typhoid fever and skin infections are most commonly seen among the displaced, living for weeks in unhygienic conditions, baluch told the associated press. pediatrician sultan mustafa said he treated some 600 patients at a field clinic established by the dua foundation charity in the jhuddo area in sindh, mostly women and children with gastrointestinal infections, scabies, malaria or dengue.khalid mushtaq, heading a team of doctors from the alkhidmat foundation and the pakistan islamic medical association, said they are treating more than 2,000 patients a day and were also providing kits containing a month's supply of water-purification tablets, soaps and other items. on friday, the representative of the u.n. children’s agency in pakistan, abdullah fadil, said after visiting sindh’s flood-hit

its main water plant roughly two weeks ago, jackson, mississippi, has been in a public health emergency. for one week, the city’s 150,000 residents had no water coming out of their taps. residents lined up in hours-long lines for drive-through bottled water sites, nonprofits delivered to people who didn’t have the means to travel and schools went virtual. in 2021, after a historic winter storm forced the city’s main water plant to shut down, jacksonians went without water for a month. since then, the city has been dealing with a cycle of boil water notices. those directives were issued due to the risk of contamination because of low water pressure.when the water was turned back on, residents still needed to boil their water before drinking or bathing. videos of coffee-colored water coming out of jackson’s taps went viral. but the city’s water crisis didn’t start with the latest storm — the public utility has been plagued with problems for the last three decades. and officials know it will happen again. “without critical and very important capital improvements to be made of our water treatment facility, it’s not a matter of if it will fail again, but a matter of when it will fail again,” mayor chokwe antar lumumba said on npr last week.it’s going to take massive investments from the state and federal government to finally end the cycles of boil water notices and water system failures. mississippi gov. tate reeves (r) has floated the idea of turning over the city’s utility to a private company, but privatization of public goods has long been derided by experts.“privatization is on the table,” reeves said earlier this month. “i’m open to ideas.” jackson, which is 80% black, has already attempted to partner with a private company to fix some of its water infrastructure issues. in 2010, the city signed a $90 million contract with siemens, a private company that was supposed to install new water meters. but the meters were faulty. this led to some customers not receiving bills and others being unable to pay due to being overcharged. those unpaid bills meant that the ailing system had even fewer resources. the city successfully sued siemens in 2020, but in the interim, the water system got worse.rep. bennie thompson (d), who serves mississippi’s 2nd district, is wary of letting the city control its water. “we want a system that meets federal and state regulations,” he said. “now if we see that jackson can’t do it, then obviously we have to look at an alternative.”but the problems facing jacksonians, an underinvested and aging system, won’t be helped by privatizing it, water system experts argue. handing over a public water system to a corporation more concerned with profit has already shown time and time, again, that it won’t fix the problem.a march 2022 cornell university study of the 500 largest water systems in the united states found that privatization often resulted in problems. “what was disturbing about the 500 water systems is that private ones had higher rates and more affordability problems,” said mildred warner, a cornell professor and an author of the study. “and this was true after we controlled for the age of the system and the source of the water.”there was an outlier, however. california strictly regulates private water companies, ensuring affordability for low-income people. but a republican governor is unlikely to follow suit. “mississippi probably doesn’t have the policy environment that’s going to closely regulate the private operator to make sure public objectives are met,” warner said.“the history is extensive in terms of what happens when a private company pillages public resources or public utilities,” lumumba said on npr. “private companies are not coming to be benevolent. they’re coming to make a profit.”jackson is facing a clear-cut example of environmental racism. after its schools were forced to integrate in the 1970s, white people began leaving the city in droves — taking with them their tax revenue. today, one in four people in jackson lives in poverty. the city’s water system is also old and in need of expensive repairs, but the city simply doesn’t have the tax base to support it. currently, the mayor estimates that the city would need at least $1 billion to permanently fix its water problems.and while privatization may be on the mind of reeves and other state officials, there’s plenty of evidence to show that turning jackson’s water system over to a private company could make the problem worse – which is what happened in pittsburgh.the pennsylvania city’s water and sewer authorities were dealing with aging infrastructure, financial distress, and administrative problems. in 2012, the pittsburgh water system signed a contract with veolia to fix its water problems. under the contract, veolia would get to keep 50 cents for every dollar that was saved.the private company, to save costs, switched to a new billing system that often overcharged customers, laid off staff, and perhaps most consequential, used a cheaper corrosion control chemical that led to increased lead levels in the city’s drinking water. notably, the switch happened without the approval of the utility board or the city. the utility switched back to the original corrosion control chemical, but residents who were affected still filed a class action lawsuit. the private company and public officials blamed each other for the lead problem, with veolia saying it was acting as a consulting company only. while privatization of water companies has led to increased rates and undrinkable water, public water systems aren’t immune to these problems as well. in flint, michigan, after the local government switched to cheaper corrosion control, the water was poisoned with lead. but, just like privatization efforts, the problem began when the city tried to save money.that’s the central problem with water privatization. it takes a public good — one that’s needed to survive – and turns it into another profit-maker at the expense of residents.“privatization is taking people from one state of misery to the next,” lumumba said. “we have to depart from this notion that privatization is the only way that the system can be supported.”by entering your email and clicking sign up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages

time,” andrew kosove and broderick johnson — the co-ceos of alcon entertainment, which holds the rights to “blade runner” — told the hollywood reporter in a statement.“so, we recognize that we have a very high bar to meet with this next installment. … we hope that we can live up to that standard and delight audiences with the next generation of blade runner.”“2049” was a box office disappointment, grossing $92 million domestically, according to box office mojo. fans of the original, however, were stunned by its quality and the melancholy atmosphere that villeneuve delivered. it holds an 88% “fresh” rating from critics on rotten tomatoes.adult swim later produced an animated series called “blade runner: black lotus,” which debuted in november and appears to have stalled. “2099,” meanwhile, will be the franchise’s first live-action tv project — and has its creators salivating with glee.“we are delighted to continue our working relationship with our friends at amazon,” kosove and johnson told the hollywood reporter. “and we are beyond excited to continue to extend the blade runner canon into a new realm with the provocative storyline that silka has created.”trends

residency stands a slim chance of winning enough republican support to become law in the near future.the u.s. brought in tens of thousands of people as part of its hasty retreat from afghanistan last year but has not said that they can stay. the afghan adjustment act, introduced in august by sen. amy klobuchar (d-minn.) with three republican co-sponsors, would create a path to permanent residency for more than 77,000 afghans who have arrived in the u.s. since last summer. “giving our afghan allies – many of whom worked alongside our u.s. military – a chance to apply for permanent legal status is the right and necessary thing to do,” klobuchar told huffpost in a statement. “this bipartisan legislation will provide afghans who submit to additional vetting a green card to live and work in the united states.”the bill would also expand eligibility for so-called special immigrant visas to other at-risk groups still in afghanistan, such as certain former members of the afghan armed forces.“these people have no place to go,” bill co-sponsor sen. lindsey graham (r-s.c.) told huffpost. “their country has fallen into hell.”but graham acknowledged that it would be difficult to win over enough republicans to get the bill through the senate, saying his colleagues have “a legitimate concern” that afghan nationals could pose a security risk. sen. rick scott (r-fla.), for instance, argued that president joe biden’s administration failed to vet the 80,000 afghans admitted to the u.s. last year. a defense department report from february said its records on 50 afghan evacuees indicated “potentially significant security concerns.”“i think we need to start by finding out who’s here and what their background is, and making sure people around the country know where these people went to,” scott told huffpost. as november’s midterm elections approach, republicans have been more hostile toward immigrants in general, with some describing them as invaders pouring through an insecure southern border. gop governors have even sent buses and planes full of migrants to democratic-led cities as a political stunt.in august 2021, the biden administration used a measure known as humanitarian parole to allow afghans to enter the u.s. for a two-year period. officials ran evacuees’ fingerprints and records through criminal and terrorism databases at military installations in europe and the middle east. parole is not recognized as an immigration status, and it offers no road to permanent residency. the main options for afghans are asylum and special immigrant status, but these can be complicated and costly to attain.the biden administration announced in march that afghans would be eligible for temporary protected status, preventing them from having to return to unsafe conditions, but tps does not guarantee permanent residency.advocates of the afghan adjustment act — who point to the fact that afghans in the u.s. could lose eligibility for humanitarian parole or temporary protected status next year and potentially face deportation — are optimistic about the bill’s prospects.“even if we run out of time this month, we have other opportunities to get this done,” said chris purdy, the director of veterans for american ideals and outreach at the nonprofit human rights first. “passing this bill is a major priority for members in both houses. and every time we’ve brought this to congress, we’ve gotten more and more supporters. passage of the afghan adjustment act is not a matter of if; it’s a matter of when.”there has been less violence in afghanistan since the u.s. finished its withdrawal last summer, but the ruling taliban reportedly still target former members of the military and government officials, despite a declared amnesty. the government is accused of persecuting minority groups and imprisoning and torturing journalists, while women face restrictive new laws. the country is also experiencing an economic crisis, which is primarily the result of frozen assets in the united states, as well as other factors such as drought.still, the near future is unlikely to see a critical mass of support for protecting afghan evacuees, and republicans could take control of one or both chambers of congress next year, which would make this even more difficult. “i just wish we could all agree, conceptually, that the people who are here have no place to go back, and they were involved in a war that we were involved in for 20 years and how we treat them will say a lot about how people will fight with us in the future,” graham said. on thursday, a small number of supporters rallied for the bill outside of congress. “many of those we are advocating for, if not all, have made the ultimate sacrifice by putting their lives in danger protecting democracy and helping our men and women in uniform,” jawaid kotwal, an afghan american, told huffpost.“so we owe it to them. we did it in the past, for vietnamese and kurds. so it’s the moral responsibility of the u.s. government to protect these people, and those who have already made it, to give them a pathway and road map towards citizenship.”afghan fellow, huffpostsenior

(ap) — sarah collins rudolph lost an eye and still has pieces of glass inside her body from a ku klux klan bombing that killed her sister and three other black girls at an alabama church 59 years ago, and she’s still waiting on the state to compensate her for those injuries.gov. kay ivey sidestepped the question of financial compensation two years ago in apologizing to rudolph for her “untold pain and suffering,” saying legislative involvement was needed. but nothing has been done despite the efforts of attorneys representing rudolph, leaving unresolved the question of payment even though victims of other attacks, including 9/11, were compensated.rudolph, known as the “fifth little girl” for surviving the infamous attack on 16th street baptist church, which was depicted in spike lee’s 1997 documentary “4 little girls,” has been rankled by the state’s inaction.speaking in an interview with the associated press, rudolph said then-gov. george c. wallace helped lay the groundwork for the klan attack with his segregationist rhetoric, and the state bears some responsibility for the bombing, which wasn’t prosecuted for years.“if they hadn’t stirred up all that racist hate that was going on at the time i don’t believe that church would have been bombed,” said rudolph.rudolph attended a white house summit about combatting hate-fueled violence on thursday, the anniversary of the bombing, and was recognized by president joe biden.“i visited the church on this day in 2019, and i’ll visit with you and always remember what happened,” biden told rudolph.in birmingham, hundreds gathered at the church for a commemorative service and wreath-laying at the spot where the bomb went off.rudolph said she still incurs medical expenses from the explosion, including a $90 bill she gets every few months for work on the prosthetic she wears in place of the right eye that was destroyed by shrapnel on sept. 15, 1963. anything would help, but rudolph believes she’s due millions.ishan bhabha, an attorney representing rudolph, said the state’s apology — made at rudolph’s request along with a plea for restitution — was only meant as a first step.“she deserves justice in the form of compensation for the grievous injuries, and costs, she has had to bear for almost 60 years,” he said. “we will continue to pursue any available avenues to get sarah the assistance she needs and deserves.”five girls were gathered in a downstairs bathroom at 16th street baptist church when a bomb planted by kkk members went off outside, blowing a huge hole in the thick, brick wall. the blast killed denise mcnair, 11, and three 14-year-olds: carole robertson, cynthia morris, also referred to as cynthia wesley, and addie mae collins, who was rudolph’s sister.three klan members convicted of murder in the bombing years later died in prison, and a fourth suspect died without ever being charged. the bombing occurred eight months after wallace proclaimed “segregation forever” in his inaugural speech and during the time when birmingham schools were being racially integrated for the first time.the church itself has gotten government money for renovations, as has the surrounding birmingham civil rights national monument, formed by president barack obama in 2017 in one of his last acts in office. “but not me,” rudolph said.ivey, at the time of the apology, said in a letter to rudolph’s lawyer that any possible compensation would require legislative approval, said press secretary gina maiola.“additionally, in attorney-to-attorney conversations that ensued soon after, that same point was reiterated,” she said.no bill has been introduced to compensate rudolph, legislative records show, and it’s unclear whether such legislation could win passage anyway since conservative republicans hold an overwhelming majority and have made an issue of reeling in history lessons that could make white people feel bad about the past.while the alabama crime victims’ compensation commission helps victims and families with expenses linked to a crime, state law doesn’t allow it to address offenses that occurred before the agency was created in 1984.rudolph has spent a lifetime dealing with physical and mental pain from the bombing. despite her injuries and lingering stress disorders, rudolph provided testimony that helped lead to the convictions of the men accused of planting the bomb, and she’s written a book about her life, titled “the 5th little girl.”rudolph’s husband, george rudolph, said he’s frustrated and mad over the way his wife has been treated. victims of the sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks were compensated, he said, as were victims of the boston marathon bombing in 2013.“why can’t they do something for sarah?” he said.___reeves is a member of ap’s

(ap) — carey wooten spent nearly seven weeks hunting for safe drinking water for herself, her two children and three dogs after clocking out each day as a taco bell manager, so gov. tate reeves' announcement that the water is clean again in mississippi's capital came as welcome news.but the crisis in the city of jackson isn't over, even if its boil-water advisory was lifted on thursday. while the state plans to stop handing out free bottled water at sites around the city saturday night, the city said water pressure still hasn’t been fully restored, and state health officials said lead in some pipes remains so worrisome that pregnant women and young children should still use bottled water. “the water that’s coming out of my kitchen sink smells like fresh sewage ... as soon as you turn it on, it hits you right in the face. it’s horrible,” wooten said earlier this month. “i’ve tried to give one of my dogs the water, but when she smells it she won’t even touch it. she walks away from it.”wooten said friday that the liquid flowing into her kitchen sink still smells like sewage, but not as bad as before, and she's glad she won't have to run to distribution sites before their bottled water supplies run out each day.other residents told the associated press on friday that their water remains too discolored to count on, so now they'll have to rely on water distribution by community-run charities or buy water again themselves, adding insult to injury. jackson had already been under a state health department boil-water notice for a month when torrential rain fell in august, flooding the pearl river and overwhelming the treatment system. water pressure abruptly dropped, emptying faucets for days.how did this happen? residents, politicians, experts and activists say systemic racism is the root cause. jackson's population has declined since 1980, a decade after the city's schools began integrating. many white families left for the suburbs, leaving less revenue to maintain the infrastructure. middle class black people then moved out to escape urban decay and rising crime. state and federal spending never made up the difference.“the legacy of racial zoning, segregation, legalized redlining have ultimately led to the isolation, separation and sequestration of racial minorities into communities (with) diminished tax bases, which has had consequences for the built environment, including infrastructure,” said marccus hendricks, an associate professor of urban studies and planning at the university of maryland.other cities across the united states could face similar challenges with aging water systems that are ill-equipped to handle more intense and frequent flooding caused by climate change, experts in water infrastructure and environmental justice told the associated press.and when it comes to water scarcity and contamination, they say working-class communities of color are most vulnerable. jackson's population is more than 80% black and the poverty level is 24.5%, according to the u.s. census bureau. majority-black flint, michigan, has struggled to remove lead from its water since 2014. other areas where large poor or nonwhite populations lack reliably safe drinking water include major cities like baltimore and honolulu as well as smaller municipalities like las vegas, new mexico; and benton harbor, michigan.heather mcteer toney worked to clean up discolored tap water as mayor of greenville, mississippi, before serving as the environmental protection agency’s southeast regional administrator from 2014 to 2017. now she works on environmental justice issues nationwide for the environmental defense fund. she said many majority-minority communities lack consistent access to clean water.“any community that is suffering from lack of infrastructure maintenance is dealing with the same problem, maybe just on a different scale,” toney said. “but across the nation, with .... poor communities that are often black, brown, indigenous and on the frontlines of the climate crisis, we see the same thing happening over and over again.”hendricks and toney blame systemic racism for government disinvestment in communities of color. maisie brown calls jackson’s troubles “the product of environmental racism.”“i don’t think we realize how deeply ingrained racism is in all of our structures and systems, including infrastructure,” said brown, a 20-year-old student at jackson state university who was born and raised in the city.brown is a member of the mississippi students water crisis advocacy team, a group of about 30 students delivering water to residents who are disabled, elderly or don’t have vehicles. that’s what relief has looked like in jackson — the people most affected doing what they can to help each other. but the limited handouts each day haven't been enough, forcing people to buy water in stores. the two cases wooten and nearly 500 others picked up at the site in south jackson one day contained just under nine gallons (30 liters). that's less than 3% of the roughly 300 gallons (1,136 liters) that the epa says the average american family uses each day. needed improvements at the city's two treatment plants include replacing ineffective pumps, leaky filters, faulty membranes and corroded pipes; removing accumulated sludge and hiring enough qualified staff to properly manage the system. mayor chokwe antar lumumba, a democrat, has pleaded for patience while seeking state and federal help, saying such fixes could cost billions of dollars that the city doesn’t have. epa administrator michael regan said while visiting jackson that he wants the city to get its fair share of federal money flowing to the state. reeves, a republican, has not said how much mississippi should spend on solving this problem. the legislature directed $400 million of federal pandemic relief funds toward water infrastructure upgrades around the state, but it’s unclear how much jackson will receive because cities are still applying for money. \"we cannot perfectly predict what may go wrong with such a broken system in the future,” reeves said thursday.without reliable funding streams, many jackson residents don’t expect to see consistently drinkable water anytime soon.karla mccullough, 46, is a black woman and jackson native who runs a charity that helped organize the distribution site where wooten got her water. she told the ap that the city's residents have experienced some level of water scarcity their entire lives.“i want to be hopeful and optimistic,” mccullough said. “in my lifetime, i may not see the infrastructure fixed and it restored to a point where there are not any water issues. but my hope is that my son and his children won’t have to deal with this.”___emily wagster pettus contributed to this report. follow drew costley on twitter: @drewcostley.___the associated press health and science department receives support from the howard

will come less than a month after its 35th anniversary.it is a costly musical to sustain, with elaborate sets and costumes as well as a large cast and orchestra. box office grosses have fluctuated

complied with a justice department subpoena and turned over records as part of a federal investigation into the jan. 6, 2021 assault on the capitol and efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, a person familiar the matter said thursday.the records produced by meadows are the same ones he earlier provided to a house committee conducting a similar investigation, according to the person, who spoke with the associated press on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing justice department probe.the subpoena to meadows, first reported by cnn, makes clear that justice department officials are seeking information from the most senior of trump’s white house advisers as they examine wide-ranging efforts to overturn the results of the election won by democrat joe biden.the department, whose work at times has mirrored or overlapped with that of the committee, this month served a broad wave of grand jury subpoenas and search warrants to trump allies.meadows has been a pivotal figure in the house investigation, his name invoked repeatedly in testimony by other trump advisers, including by his own top aide. he had provided the committee with thousands of text messages, including communications with outside trump allies and advisers.in a filing in april in a federal lawsuit over his house subpoena, a lawyer for meadows accused the committee of trying to vilify him publicly, noting that all of the texts it had been provided had been disclosed to the news media. the committee declined at the time to respond to the accusation.meadows did not provide to

here several times a week,” she says, pointing to a corner of the young adult section that often acts as a background for her many viral tiktoks. “i usually stack two or three books to create a sort of stand.” she demonstrates her typical filming strategy, which is a test of both physics and balance, and points out the spot where her anticipated ya novel, “lightlark,” will sit on the shelves; it’s just above best-selling authors victoria aveyard and leigh bardugo.we spend the next 30 minutes wandering the stacks hunting for jennette mccurdy’s hotly debated memoir, “i’m glad my mom died.” despite our best efforts — and introverted refusal to ask for help — we can’t find the book. instead, she buys a beige tote bag with a picture of her second home, the famed union square b&n in new york city, and “big magic” by elizabeth gilbert. she gives me the book, recounting how it completely changed her life.while the “eat, pray, love” author might have bettered aster’s insight into her own creativity, it’s not the only thing that changed the course of her life. that accolade goes to tiktok — or, more specifically, booktok, a community on the social media platform dedicated to readers and authors who share their favorite books, characters and literary anecdotes.after hundreds of rejections — seriously, she’s been writing books and querying agents since she was 12 years old — aster joined tiktok in march 2021 to share the concept of a young adult novel she’d been working on for several years. the novel, “lightlark,” had recently received tons of rejections from publishers and she was determined to prove that she wasn’t the only person in the world who wanted to read it.“every single publisher was mainly saying that the genre is so saturated. that’s when i decided to make the tiktok video ... i put everything i love into [“lightlark”] and so it [was] me asking the void, asking the internet, ‘would you read this book?’”the video, which has since received over 1.8 million views, over 363,000 likes, and more than 56,000 saves, shows alex scrolling through her manuscript before cutting away to a series of fantasy-inspired pinterest photos to what sounds like a new-age ballad. the captions on her video read: “would you read a book about a cursed island that only appears once every hundred years to host a game that gives the six rulers of [each] realm a chance to break their curses? each realm’s curse is deadly and to break them, one of the six rulers must die. to survive, isla crown must lie, cheat, betray even as love complicates everything.”with fate, an enticing story, and the algorithm on her side, her video went viral overnight. her novel went to auction and sold two weeks later in a deal that was 10 times what she was paid for her critically acclaimed, award-winning middle grade series “emblem island.”“it was like a bunch of years of work mixed with, like, luck that i could never have anticipated,” aster says of the viral video. she even accidentally started her own trend, with hundreds of other writers pitching their novels in a similar format with the same audio.aster and her publisher, abrams books, have used tiktok ever since to help market the novel. they even went as far as to let booktok pick the cover of the novel, an unheard of option in the realm of traditional publishing, which usually takes years of marketing research and trend reports into account. the cover, which received over 10,000 votes in a weekend, was then revealed on a massive billboard in times square.“my publisher has been extremely open and collaborative; this is a new generation, gen z is shopping differently and they really care about the person behind the book,” aster said. “if i’ve done anything revolutionary, it’s probably that i crowdsource my audience for publishing ... it’s been very cool to see this very old industry be able to shift so quickly to meet with this new trend that is booktok that’s literally changing the industry.”a year and a half after posting her initial video to tiktok, “lightlark” is on the shelves, a timeline considered rushed by publishing standards. even before the novel came out, aster landed a massive movie deal with the producers of “twilight” — she’s team edward, by the way — and her agents secured publishing rights in 13 languages. she also became one of the most followed authors on tiktok with nearly 1 million followers and started work on a sequel to the novel. “lightlark” had a first-print run of over 200,000 copies, almost unheard of in the publishing industry.while some authors claim booktok doesn’t move the needle in terms of sales, aster’s proved them wrong, becoming an instant new york times bestseller. “lightlark” debuted at no. 1 during its first week of publication — proof that the community she cultivated did buy her novel. the year’s worth of daily tiktok posts and instagram questionnaires were well worth the time and effort, despite the naysayers.now, she’s well on her way to becoming gen z’s stephanie meyer — sans questionable bipoc representation — at just 27 years old. in between writing the sequel to her novel at coffee shops with fellow gen z author chloe gong, sharing her custom-made “lightlark” mugs on instagram or taking followers on one of her mid-afternoon iced coffee runs on tiktok, aster’s giving us a behind-the-scenes look into the life of a published author. and this might be the new norm for up-and-coming authors of this generation and those who come after. they’ve grown up with social media and know how to navigate each app to build a connection with their readers in a way that feels authentic, not elitist, and inspires them to pursue their own dreams.“it’s really cool because we’re just peers with our readers. it’s not like the author is above the reader anymore. we’re one of the readers, and i think that lends to a community of discussion and collaboration that wasn’t really there before,” aster said. “i get to interact with people in a way that maybe wasn’t possible before. i recognize people’s names when they message me and it just gives me access to my readers in a way that i don’t think was possible before. we want to be a part of these communities. we don’t want to be separate from them.”“i think what really resonates with people is that i’ve never shied away from sharing my struggles,” she said of her journey. “i just never wanted to gloss over the negative part [of this industry]. i was never the best writer, i was never the best person, the best author, i was literally just the person who didn’t give up ... why paint a pretty picture when it’s just not the truth? i have failed way more than i’ve succeeded in my life. i just didn’t stop.”still, despite her hard-earned success, some booktok creators have questioned whether or not aster is a “industry plant.” aster grew up on television, where she and her twin sister, daniella pierson — one of the youngest multi-millionaires in the world — starred in her parent’s jacksonville toyota dealership commercials. she acknowledges the financial privilege she has, noting in the comments of one tiktok video that she has zero student debt, was able to live with family while she wrote her novels, and is on her fiancé’s health insurance, but stresses that she had no industry connections in publishing or film prior to her viral success. she also confirmed to huffpost that she did not put any paid promotion behind any of her tiktoks.“i know people are confused about how i got a movie deal before the book is published, but the truth is that happens all the time ... i’m proud to say that i didn’t have or use any connections to get my book or movie deal,” she said. “i think people only see the last year of my life that has been rapidly successful, but the truth is i’ve been writing and trying to get published for over a decade. also, industry plants in publishing are not a thing. i think it’s unfortunate people will grasp at straws to try to invalidate someone’s success, but ultimately i think it’s more of a reflection on them than it is on me.”in fact, it might be aster’s minor in consumer psychology that makes her such a powerful marketer for rapid success. she knows how to relate to the audience she’s appealing to and is open and honest about all her experiences, even if they sometimes seem too good to be true. even before the original “lightlark” tiktok went viral, aster had become an up-and-coming tiktok star with several of her own songs becoming trending sounds. bella poarch, who now has over 91 million followers, used her song “you think you’re” in a video in late 2020. while aster has since removed the music from the app — she says the music industry is “even worse than publishing” and didn’t want her new followers to be confused when finding her through booktok — her aptitude for consumer marketing and the tiktok algorithm remain. that, and her passion for publishing the best book possible.aster had always wanted to be a novelist. she spent every day after middle school writing in her room or barnes & noble and even spent a majority of her high school lunches hunched over a laptop working on yet another manuscript. by the time she graduated from the university of pennsylvania in 2017, she’d written four books and finally had gotten an agent. in fact, she landed her agent the day she graduated and even skipped her commencement ceremony to finalize her choice among three offering agents. she describes the moment “like fate,” until it all came crashing down.after her first book, an adult thriller, didn’t sell to a publisher, she left her agent and started working on a middle-grade series based on her colombian heritage. unfortunately, despite starred reviews and awards, “emblem island” was released during the pandemic and, like many other debut works during this time, saw slow sales. she eventually parted ways with her second agent and wrote the first draft of “lightlark” sans representation. even after landing a third agent, “lightlark” continued to be rejected. it’s for this reason aster attributes her latest novel’s publication entirely to the booktok community. she says she feels both indebted and grateful that they saw something in her plea to the void. “i would have never been in this position if it wasn’t for their support.”transparency is at the heart of aster’s own approach to social media. she posts several times a day on tiktok and instagram, giving readers an intimate look into her life as an author. from signing copies of her novel for seven hours straight to flying across the country on short notice for secret “lightlark” business trips, she documents every part of her writing journey.“i’m on social media more than i write,” aster said. “i think it’s a new thing for authors to be required and also expected to have a social media platform. there is a lot of pressure ... it has played such a huge role in my career that i can’t stop and so it’s the biggest blessing and something i’m extremely grateful for, but it’s a lot of additional work. i have to keep up with it because of the algorithm and because now people are expecting it from me.”while she might spend upward of five hours every single day filming tiktoks that’ll never see the light of day (seriously, she says she has thousands of unposted drafts), she says she can’t complain because the entire community has made her lifelong dream a reality.still, with her newfound internet stardom comes a host of trolls and people who want to discount her years of hard work and dedication. even worse, some of the commenters on her videos have referred to her as a white author (she’s of indigenous colombian ancestry). aster says she’s even noticed this happening within the publishing industry itself. as a latina who previously wrote a book inspired by her latin roots, she says there was a sort of tokenization that happened for “emblem island” that isn’t happening for “lightlark.” while “lightlark” might not be marketed as a latinx book, it is still written by a latina author and contains tons of nods to aster’s heritage, like the main character’s name being isla, which means island in spanish. but, aster’s not letting tiktok or the publishing industry erase her identity. she doesn’t shy away from correcting people who incorrectly call her white and she isn’t afraid to talk about the pigeonholing that happened when she was on submission for “emblem island.”“i did hear some of the stuff that you think of as horror stories ... like big editors said ‘oh, we already have like a latinx book, and it’s better than this one.’ and to get that feedback, i saw at that point, there’s only a limited number of spaces for latinx books and latinx authors. and so it’s really interesting now that [“lightlark” wasn’t marketed as a latinx book] that suddenly there’s all this space.”even when it comes to the panels she’s asked to speak on now. before, she was only invited to latinx author panels. now, she’s been invited to speak at comic-con on a panel that has nothing to do with race or ethnicity. “it’s definitely interesting to see the different response when this isn’t blatantly marketed as a latinx book. i’ve seen both parts of the industry, the industry that doesn’t have enough room for me because they have a certain amount of books and then the industry that opens up because suddenly like, for some reason, this book is different. it’s a complicated feeling.” aster notes that when her publisher was marketing “emblem island,” it was usually referred to only as a latinx fantasy. while she was grateful that people who were looking for that specific type of book could find it, she got to a point where she wanted the series simply to be referred to as a fantasy. “at some level, it’s not like you talk about a book and say, ‘it’s like a russian magic system’ or ‘it’s a french magic system’; no, you just talk about it as a fantasy.”thankfully, booktok influencers are saving the day when it comes to making sure novels by people of color are getting their flowers. aster shouted out a few creators like @aymansbooks, @thecalvinsbooks, and even the founder of booktok herself, @caitsbooks, who act as trendsetters in the book community. “they’re deciding what people are reading ... they’re the new tastemakers of the industry,” she said, noting that even someone with a thousand followers can go viral and become an instant literary arbiter. “i think [tiktok] is changing the book industry. [now,] it’s not just whatever books are in the front row with a shelf that’s what’s going to sell. it’s whatever books are resonating with people and i think people are getting a lot more chances. i think there’s a lot of power in that anyone, even if you have one follower or a million followers, you can go viral. there’s a lot of hope in that.”needless to say, aster’s come a long way from writing novels in her childhood bedroom. “lightlark” is just the beginning of what’s sure to be an incredibly successful career. the ya novel is full of wonder, magic, and even a to-die-for love triangle that easily rivals “twilight” (she’s team isla, for what it’s worth). and, while she’s thrilled with the reception “lightlark” continues to get from fans around the world, she wants other aspiring authors to not be so hard on themselves.“i was really sad for many years because i thought i was a failure. but, looking back, i see everything happened the way it was supposed to, i just needed to be a little more patient and a little kinder to myself.”it’s this kindness that, perhaps, makes aster a breath of fresh air in the world of publishing. and part of the reason she identifies so closely with the starling realm in her book. she’s ethereal, dedicated, creative and ready to start a new era in the publishing world.on assignment for huffpost\n","Text data saved successfully.\n","trends reportera woman being carjacked while carrying her baby on wednesday received help from a local hero.the woman was taking her child out of her car outside a chick-fil-a in fort walton beach, florida, when a man approached her with a stick, according to the washington post. he then snatched her keys away and entered the vehicle as she screamed out for help.those cries were answered by chick-fil-a worker mikel gordon, who witnessed the ordeal and rushed to her aid. footage shows gordon getting into an altercation with the man, whom the okaloosa county sheriff’s office identified in a facebook post as 43-year-old william branch.“the victim was getting the infant out of her car at a restaurant at 743 beal parkway when she says branch approached her wielding a stick and demanding her keys,” the sheriff’s office wrote. “he then grabbed the keys from the waistband of her pants, opened the door, and got inside.”the one-minute video was filmed by a witness from the safety of their car. it shows gordon tackling a man to the ground and putting him in a headlock. his colleagues eventually arrived, alongside a woman carrying her baby — who doled out some verbal justice.“she had a baby in her hand,” the woman screamed. “she had a baby in her hand!

(ap) — business and government officials are bracing for the possibility of a nationwide rail strike at the end of this week while talks carry on between the largest u.s. freight railroads and their unions.the railroads have already started to curtail shipments of hazardous materials and have announced plans to stop hauling refrigerated products ahead of friday’s strike deadline. now businesses that rely on norfolk southern, union pacific, bnsf, csx, kansas city southern and other railroads to deliver their raw materials and finished products have started planning for the worst.meanwhile, biden administration officials are scrambling to develop a plan to use trucks, ships and planes to try to keep the most crucial chemicals and other goods moving if the railroads stop rolling. but the white house is also keeping the pressure on the two sides to settle their differences, and a growing number of business groups are lobbying congress to be prepared to intervene and block a strike if they can’t reach an agreement.“we have made crystal clear to the interested parties the harm that american families, business and farmers and communities would experience if they were not to reach a resolution,” white house press secretary karine jean-pierre said tuesday. she said a shutdown is “not acceptable.”in addition to all the businesses that rely on railroads to deliver their goods, passenger railroads are also affected because many of them operate on tracks owned by one of the freight railroads. amtrak has already cancelled several of its long-distance trains because there wouldn’t be enough time for them to reach their destinations before a strike or lockout would be allowed to begin at 12:01 a.m. friday.amtrak already suspended its california zephyr and empire builder lines that run from chicago to the west coast, and starting wednesday it will stop running its city of new orleans, starlight and texas eagle lines along with several others.commuter railroads would also be affected. in chicago, metra warned its riders that it wouldn’t be able to run most of its trains if there is a strike.the railroads have reached tentative agreements with most of their unions, including a ninth deal announced tuesday, based on the recommendations of a presidential emergency board joe biden appointed this summer that called for 24% raises and $5,000 in bonuses in a five-year deal that’s retroactive to 2020. the deal also includes one additional paid leave day a year and higher health insurance costs.but all 12 railroad unions must agree to prevent a strike. the brotherhood of locomotive engineers and trainmen union that represents engineers, and the transportation division of the international association of sheet metal, air, rail and transportation workers union that represents conductors want the railroads to address some of their concerns about unpredictable work schedules and strict attendance rules in addition to agreeing to the recommended wage increases.ron kaminkow, general secretary of the railroad workers united labor coalition that includes workers from a variety of railroad unions, said he doesn’t think the unions are demanding much at this point — just the kind of things most u.s. workers already enjoy like the ability to take time off without being penalized.“we have attendance policies that have gotten more and more and more draconian. that offer very, very little leeway for workers who need to take time off for doctor’s appointments, for time with family, to be rested,” kaminkow said.starting monday, all the major railroads put a hold on shipments of hazardous materials to ensure those dangerous chemicals wouldn’t be stranded along the tracks if there is a strike. norfolk southern told its customers that it will also stop accepting shipments of intermodal containers full of goods starting wednesday evening as it prepares “for a controlled shutdown of the network.”some businesses would likely be affected more than others by a rail shutdown. for instance, nearly all ethanol and coal and most grain moves by rail.___associated press writers seung min kim and zeke miller contributed to this report from

succeed retiring rep. jim langevin (d) on tuesday.magaziner, a business-friendly liberal who raised the most money in the field and was endorsed by langevin, defeated five other contenders seeking the democratic nomination in rhode island’s 2nd congressional district. his victory is a win for the state’s democratic party establishment and allied groups, which saw him as the most viable general-election candidate.magaziner is due to face republican nominee allan fung, the former mayor of cranston, rhode island, in november. national republicans have indicated that they plan to seriously contest the seat. they see fung, who characterizes himself as a centrist, as the kind of candidate who can win in a politically and geographically diverse district that president joe biden would have carried by 14 percentage points in 2020.but democrats plan to lump fung in with his republican backers, turning the race into a referendum on gop control of the house rather than fung’s personal merits or reputation as a mayor.“there’s certainly nothing moderate about supporting [house republican leader] kevin mccarthy, who has made clear that he wants to cut social security and medicare and pass a national abortion ban,” magaziner told huffpost last week. mccarthy has indicated that he will entertain legislation restricting abortion on a national level but has not specified his plans. fung, who supports allowing abortions in cases of rape and incest, has said he would not prioritize limits on abortion rights, though he did not rule out support for federal bans in an interview with the boston globe after the u.s. supreme court’s abortion-restricting decision in dobbs v. jackson women’s health in june. but fung gave democrats an opening to nationalize the race in august when he welcomed mccarthy to rhode island for a fundraiser. he also attended a retreat for republican donors that mccarthy hosted in wyoming later that month.fung, who ran two competitive but ultimately unsuccessful races for governor, identifies as a fiscal conservative focused on trimming budgets and improving government services for constituents. the son of immigrants from hong kong, fung would be rhode island’s first non-white member of congress.“i would definitely be proud to kind of kick open that bamboo ceiling, ensure that other individuals can follow behind,” he told the globe. “but the most important thing is those pocketbook issues, wallet issues, that we’re all facing in rhode island and as a country.”magaziner, whose father, ira, was a successful management consultant and adviser to former president bill clinton, was born into a storied family in democratic politics. he parlayed his upbringing and his family’s financial success into a career in state politics, where he endeared himself to organized labor with his support for policies such as a state infrastructure bank.during the primary, magaziner, who dropped out of the governor’s race to run for congress, successfully argued that his record of statewide electoral success made him the best candidate to defeat fung. he triumphed over former langevin aide joy fox, former biden administration official sarah morgenthau, former state rep. david segal, refugee activist omar bah and former state rep. spencer dickinson. magaziner and morgenthau were the only two candidates with the resources to advertise on television.one potential liability for magaziner is that until a few months ago he lived just outside the boundaries of rhode island’s 2nd district. he and his family now rent a home in the district, and he touts his experience working in the district as general treasurer. senior politics reporter, huffpost do you have information you want to share with huffpost? here’s how.by

ukraine is likely to encounter misleading information, according to a research report published wednesday.researchers at newsguard searched for content about prominent news topics on tiktok and say they found that nearly 1 in 5 of the videos automatically suggested by the platform contained misinformation.searches for information about “mrna vaccine,\" for instance, yielded five videos (out of the first 10) that contained misinformation, including baseless claims that the covid-19 vaccine causes “permanent damage in children's critical organs.”researchers looking for information about abortion, the 2020 election, the jan. 6 insurrection at the u.s. capitol, climate change or russia's invasion of ukraine on tiktok found similarly misleading videos scattered among more accurate clips.the amount of misinformation — and the ease with which it can be found — is especially troubling given tiktok's popularity with young people, according to steven brill, founder of newsguard, a firm that monitors misinformation.tiktok is the second most popular domain in the world, according to online performance and security company cloudflare, exceeded only by google. brill questioned whether bytedance, the chinese company that owns tiktok, is doing enough to stop misinformation or whether it deliberately allows misinformation to proliferate as a way to sow confusion in the u.s. and other western democracies.“it's either incompetence or it's something worse,” brill told the associated press.tiktok released a statement in response to newsguard's report noting that its community guidelines prohibit harmful misinformation and that it works to promote authoritative content about important topics like covid-19. “we do not allow harmful misinformation, including medical misinformation, and we will remove it from the platform,” the company said. tiktok has taken other steps that it says are intended to direct users to trustworthy sources. this year, for example, the company created an election center to help u.s. voters find voting places or information about candidates.the platform removed more than 102 million videos that violated its rules in the first quarter of 2022. yet only a tiny percentage of those ran afoul of tiktok's rules against misinformation.researchers found that tiktok's own search tool seems designed to steer users to false claims in some cases. when researchers typed the words “covid vaccine\" into the search tool, for instance, the tool suggested searches on key words including “covid vaccine exposed\" and \"covid vaccine injury.\"when the same search was run on google, however, that search engine suggested searches relating to more accurate information about vaccine clinics, the different types of vaccines and booster shots.tiktok's rise in popularity has caught the attention of state officials and federal lawmakers, some of whom have expressed concerns about its data privacy and security. the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee will hold a hearing wednesday on social media's impact on the nation's security. tiktok's chief operating officer, vanessa pappas, is set to testify alongside representatives from youtube, twitter and meta, which owns instagram and facebook.___follow the ap's coverage of misinformation at https://apnews.com/hub/misinformation.\n","Text data saved

that inflation remains a heavy burden for american households.consumer prices surged 8.3% in august compared with a year earlier, the government said tuesday. though still painfully high, that was down from an 8.5% jump in july and a four-decade high of 9.1% in june. on a monthly basis, prices rose 0.1%, after a flat reading in july.excluding the volatile food and energy categories, so-called core prices jumped 0.6% from july to august, higher than many economists had expected and a sign of inflation’s persistence.inflation remains far higher than many americans have ever experienced and is keeping pressure on the federal reserve, the agency tasked with keeping prices stable. the fed is expected to announce another big increase in its benchmark interest rate next week, which will lead to higher costs for many consumer and business loans.inflation has escalated families’ grocery bills, rents and utility costs, among other expenses, inflicting hardships on many households and deepening gloom about the economy despite strong job growth and low unemployment.even if inflation peaks, economists expect it could take two years or more to fall back to something close to the fed’s annual 2% target. the cost of rental apartments and other services, such as health care, are likely to keep rising in the months ahead.republicans have sought to make inflation a central issue in the midterm congressional elections. they blame president joe biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package passed last year for much of the increase. many economists generally agree, though they also say that snarled supply chains, russia’s invasion of ukraine and widespread shortages of items like semiconductors have been key factors in the inflation surge.yet the signs that inflation might have peaked — or will soon — could bolster democrats’ prospects in the midterm elections and may already have contributed to slightly higher public approval ratings for biden. in his speeches, biden has generally stopped referring to the impact of high prices on family budgets. he has instead highlighted his administration’s recent legislative accomplishments, including a law enacted last month that’s intended to reduce pharmaceutical prices and fight climate change.nationally, the average cost of a gallon of gas has dropped to $3.71, down from just above $5 in mid-june. many businesses are also reporting signs that supply backlogs and inflation are beginning to fade.general motors has said the pandemic disruptions to overseas production of semiconductors, which have reduced auto output, have largely dissipated and that supply chain disruptions overall have improved about 80% from the worst days of the pandemic.over the past year, prices of meat, milk and fruits and vegetables have soared by double-digits. but executives at kroger, the nation’s largest grocery chain, said that falling prices for farm commodities like wheat and corn could slow cost increases for food.next week, most fed watchers expect the central bank to announce a third straight three-quarter-point hike, to a range of 3% to 3.25%. the fed’s rapid rate increases — the fastest since the early 1980s — typically lead to higher costs for mortgages, auto loans and business loans, with the goal of slowing growth and reducing inflation. the average 30-year mortgage rate jumped to nearly 5.9% last week, according to mortgage buyer freddie mac, the highest figure in nearly 14 years.chair jerome powell has said the fed will need to see several months of low inflation readings that suggest price increases are falling back toward its 2% target before it might suspend its rate hikes.wages are still rising at a strong pace — before adjusting for inflation — which has elevated demand for apartments as more people move out on their own. a shortage of available houses has also forced more people to keep renting, thereby intensifying competition for apartments.rising rents and more expensive services, such as medical care, are also keeping inflation high.by entering your email and clicking sign up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

directors, known for his radical techniques and open-ended narrative structures, has died, the french newspaper libération and deadline reported tuesday. he was 91. an elusive intellectual with a disdain for most modern american movies, godard was a defining figure of the french new wave, that unofficial troop of 1950s and ’60s filmmakers whose idiosyncratic work fixated on social and political unrest. godard outlived most of his peers, including françois truffaut, éric rohmer, jacques rivette and claude chabrol. born in paris on dec. 3, 1930, gordard enjoyed a life of wealth and literary scholarship. his father was a french-born physician who gained citizenship in switzerland, where the family lived for many years. his mother was the daughter of upscale bankers. godard discovered an affinity for movies after world war ii, when he began visiting the cinémathèque française, which houses one of the world’s largest film archives. it was there that he met truffaut, rohmer, rivette and chabrol. these five young men became fast friends, and godard began spending his free time engaging with cinema. he was determined to restore silent-film values to the well-established world of talkies. godard’s first brush with notoriety came as a critic writing for the admired new french magazine cahiers du cinéma, co-founded by andré bazin, a grandfather of the auteur theory. godard’s writing presaged the qualities we’d soon see in his own films, chiefly the notion that movies are just as powerful an art form as novels, poetry and painting.godard’s big-screen debut is one of the most auspicious directorial introductions in history, every bit as promising as d.w. griffith’s “the birth of a nation” (minus the racism), orson welles’ “citizen kane,” mike nichols’ “who’s afraid of virginia woolf?” and quentin tarantino’s “reservoir dogs.” that movie is 1960’s “breathless,” a freewheeling drama about a charming french hoodlum and the american exchange student he loves. initially envisioned as a documentary, “breathless” was shot with handheld cameras and non-artificial lighting to achieve a naturalistic feel ― novel concepts at the time. godard was the first to use prominent jump-cuts, today considered a groundbreaking advancement in film editing.“breathless” was met with ravenous reviews. in 2010, new york times critic a.o. scott wrote, “even now, at 50, it is still cool, still new, still — after all this time! — a bulletin from the future of movies.” a 2016 poll in the british magazine sight & sound named “breathless” the 13th greatest movie of all time.godard again found acclaim with the 1963 backstage drama “contempt” and the 1964 crime comedy “band of outsiders,” which appeared on time magazine’s list of the 100 greatest movies. his overall career grew increasingly political after “breathless,” chronicling such topics as financial gloom (1962’s “my life to live”), the horrors of war (1963’s “the carabineers”) and consumerism (1967’s “weekend”). godard’s staunch opposition to the vietnam war was a trademark of 1967’s “two or three things i know about her.” all the while, his work became less commercial and more elliptical. many projected marxist interpretations onto godard’s filmography, though he said in a rare interview in 2016, that he had never read karl marx’s writings.throughout most of his post-1960s career, godard’s movies were not widely released in america. regardless, his stature as a legend hardly waned. he found a minor second wind with 1982’s “passion,” a story about filmmaking that starred isabelle huppert, but most of his work was dense and obscure. in 1987, his “king lear,” a postmodern abstraction that borrows elements of the shakespeare tragedy, premiered at the cannes film festival and saw a quick two-week run stateside. in 1998, godard completed “histoire(s) du cinéma,” a nearly four-hour, subjective rumination on film history that some consider the most important piece of his later career. the director was awarded an honorary oscar in 2011, but he did not travel to america to accept the prize.despite making 18 movies between 1980 and his death, 2010’s divisive “film socialism” and 2014’s experimental 3d essay “goodbye to language” were the only projects with notable american exhibitions, as both screened at the new york film festival. the latter was acclaimed, with many critics calling it one of the year’s best. “language” won a jury prize at cannes, but a producer accepted on godard’s behalf.two precepts held steady throughout these years: godard never stopped experimenting with technology or using his platform to challenge the globe’s political strictures. amid his spotty mainstream attention over the past few decades, godard decried the so-called death of quality motion pictures. “i am not an auteur, well, not now, anyways,” he said in 2011. “we once believed we were auteurs, but we weren’t. we had no idea, really. film is over. it’s sad nobody is really exploring it. but what to do? and anyway, with mobile phones and everything, everyone is now an auteur.”sometimes accused of anti-semitism and often resistant to life as a public figure, godard went out as a cranky talent who rose to prominence in the age of affluent cinematic misfits. in 2018, he released “le livre d’image,” an essay-film full of “godard’s familiar end-of-civilization motifs,” as a los angeles times critic put it, that focused on the middle east. as of 2016, godard said he still “[hadn’t] started thinking about” how he’d like to be remembered. “i don’t think i’ve succeeded in making any really good films,” he said. “there are moments, scenes, whole movements that sing. it has all added up to a cinema of sorts, even though i’m still learning my art.”senior entertainment reporter, huffpostby entering your email and clicking sign up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners. you

salary increases they say will help improve patient care by resolving understaffing stresses that have worsened in the coronavirus pandemic.some 15,000 nurses at seven health care systems in the minneapolis and duluth areas walked out, a number the union says makes it the largest strike ever by private-sector nurses. the affected hospitals said they have recruited temporary nurses and expected to maintain most services.scores of nurses began walking the picket line at 7 a.m. outside children’s hospital in minneapolis, one of 15 hospitals affected. clad in the red t-shirts of the minnesota nurses association and carrying signs with such slogans as, “something has got to give,” several said their chief concern was patient safety.tracey dittrich, 50, a registered nurse at the hospital for nearly 24 years, said nurses are tired of “hospital administrators and managers that are telling us to do more.” the hospitals need more nurses and more support staff, and higher pay will help, she said.“there are shifts where you have three critically ill patients, and you have to decide which patient gets the care, when,” dittrich said. “i work with people all the time that go home every day and feel horrible because one child had to wait longer for medication, or another child needed to wait longer for an iv. another child maybe had to wait for a breathing treatment because we just couldn’t get to them all fast enough.”union spokesman sam fettig said the nurses chose a three-day strike, rather than an open-ended walkout, out of concern for patients.the hospitals have offered a 10-12% wage increase over three years, but nurses are seeking more than 30%. hospital leaders called their wage demands unaffordable, noting that allina and fairview hospitals have posted operating losses and that the cost of such sharp wage increases would be passed along to patients.“the union rejected all requests for mediation and held fast to wage demands that were unrealistic, unreasonable and unaffordable,” several of the twin cities hospitals under strike said in a joint statement.the statement said people with emergency issues should continue to call 911 or go to emergency rooms. it said despite staffing hospitals with “experienced nurse managers, trained replacement nurses and some existing traveler nurses” that people may see some delay in being treated.jean ross, co-president of national nurses united, billed as the largest union and professional association of registered nurses in the u.s., said more nurses across the country are pushing back and that most job actions revolve around the same core issues — staffing and pay.“the pandemic did so many things in pointing out, clarifying and shining a light on what life is like in the hospitals and what nurses are expected to do, which is a lot with very little,” ross said. “we have to have a bottom line where you just can’t shove any more patients on to that nurse.”kathy misk, another registered nurse at children’s, works in case management and helps families transition from hospital care to caring for their child at home. misk said a shortage of nurses has sometimes required keeping “high-tech” children – those who need special equipment to breathe, for example – from going home as soon as they otherwise could. raising pay could help the hospital keep nurses on staff, she said.“you don’t retain nurses with low wages,” misk said. “when you incentivize nurses with pay, what you’re saying to them is they have worth, and they are able to stay in one job.”when asked about misk’s statement that some children have not gone home as soon as they might have, nick petersen, a spokesman for children’s, said children are admitted or discharged “based on the expert judgment of the medical professionals who care for them.”the hospitals affected by the strike are operated by allina health, m health fairview, children’s hospital, north memorial and healthpartners. in duluth, it is essentia and st luke’s.separately, in wisconsin, a potential three-day strike by nurses at uw health, one of the state’s largest health systems, that was set to start tuesday was averted when the nurses and the uw hospital board reached an agreement. details weren’t immediately released.the minnesota nurses’ strike comes amid an upsurge in union activity nationwide.a national railroad strike could begin as early as friday unless congress steps in to block it. the two largest railroad unions have been demanding that the major freight carriers go beyond a proposed deal recommended by arbitrators appointed by president joe biden.some high-profile companies, including starbucks, are among those trying to stifle ongoing unionization efforts. since late last year, more than 230 u.s. starbucks stores have voted to unionize, which starbucks opposes.————ehlke reported from suburban milwaukee. steve karnowski in minneapolis contributed to this report. ahmed is a corps member for the

in america, during an impassioned speech on monday marking the renewal of his “cancer moonshot.”speaking at the john f. kennedy presidential library and museum in boston 60 years after the building’s namesake gave his famed moonshot speech, biden appealed to americans across political lines, saying the nation was poised to end the disease “as we know it.”the president harked back to the kennedy era, comparing the effort to the space race and americans’ ultimate journey to the moon.“i believe we can usher in the same unwillingness to postpone, the same national purpose that will serve to energize and measure the best of our skills, to end cancer as we know it, and even cure cancer once and for all,” he said.the effort aims to slash u.s. fatalities from cancers by 50% over the next quarter century and see many more cancers become chronic conditions that are treatable rather than fatal. cancer is expected to kill more than 609,000 americans in 2022, according to the centers for disease control and prevention, a toll exceeded only by deaths from heart disease.biden added that the plan was “bold, ambitious, and, i might add, completely doable,” pointing to existing technology and the promise of medical advancements.president biden says his \"cancer moonshot\" initiative is one of the reasons why he ran for president:\"cancer does not discriminate, red and blue. it doesn't care if you're a republican or a democrat. beating cancer is something we can do together.\" pic.twitter.com/ypltlkd9awpresident biden’s cancer moonshot will work to:- cut the cancer death rate by at least 50% over the next 25 years- turn more cancers from death sentences into chronic diseases people can live with- create a more supportive experience for patients and families“this cancer moonshot is one of the reasons why i ran for president,” biden said. “cancer does not discriminate red and blue. it doesn’t care if you’re a republican or a democrat. beating cancer is something we can do together.”biden announced dr. renee wegrzyn as the inaugural director of a new arm of the government, the advanced research projects agency for health, or arpa-h, on monday. the body will lead the nation’s efforts in health and biomedical research and “drive breakthroughs to prevent, detect and treat diseases” including cancer, alzheimer’s and diabetes, the president said. biden said he will sign a new executive order ensuring that such treatments are manufactured in america, an effort he said would enable the country to lead “the world in biotechnology and biomanufacturing, creating jobs and strengthening the supply chain.”“it’s not enough to invent technology that saves lives,” biden said. “we need to manufacture advanced biotechnologies here in the united states.”the cancer moonshot was first announced in february, and biden has long urged the nation to come together to eradicate or ease the burden of the disease.the president’s son beau biden died of brain cancer in 2015.senior

on sunday dismissed concerns about struggling swing-state republican senate candidates whose defeat in november could doom gop hopes of winning control of the chamber. “the players are on the field. we’re eight weeks away, which is kind of like saying we’re in the last two minutes of the fourth quarter,” scott told “fox news sunday.” “so, the truth is, who we have on the field is who we’re gonna play.”scott added he was “excited” about the republican nominees and projected optimism about the party’s chance of winning senate control in november.“i’m excited about the candidates that we have overall, because i do believe it gives us the opportunity to win back the majority and to return sanity in washington, which will reverberate around the country,” scott said.last month, senate minority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) cited gop “candidate quality” as a factor in the election. he acknowledged that the gop had a greater likelihood of winning control of the house than the senate.“senate races are just different — they’re statewide. candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome,” mcconnell told reporters.mcconnell’s comments have drawn criticism from factions of his own party, including sen. rick scott (r-fla.), the head of the senate gop campaign arm, who told politico he and mcconnell have a “strategic disagreement” over this.rick scott downplayed criticism of inexperienced gop senate candidates in an opinion piece for the washington examiner — without specifically mentioning mcconnell.“if you want to trash-talk our candidates to help the democrats, pipe down,” the florida republican wrote. “that’s not what leaders do. and republicans need to be leaders that build up the team and do everything they can to get the entire team over the finish line.”tim scott on sunday also rejected concerns that the supreme court decision overturning roe v. wade has energized voters against the gop in november.“i actually think that the momentum is in fact heading in our direction,” scott told “fox news sunday,” noting that republican candidates, including mehmet oz in pennsylvania, herschel walker in georgia and j.d. vance in ohio, have made gains in recent weeks.tim scott also criticized president joe biden for condemning extremist republicans backing former president donald trump’s “make america great again” ideology.“why would we have the president of the united states deliver a soul-crushing speech that was unnecessary, polarizing and inflammatory,” scott said. “we have done better, we will do better and that’s why elections have consequences.”

year’s boston marathon announced monday that nonbinary athletes will be allowed to run the prestigious race without having to register as members of the men’s or women’s divisions.the boston athletic association said that it is “currently working on expanding opportunities” for nonbinary athletes, not just at the marathon but also at the other races the association administers.registration opened monday for the 127th boston marathon, scheduled for april 17 next year. the baa is expecting a field of about 30,000 for the race, one of the most competitive in the world.according to the organization, nonbinary athletes who have completed a marathon as a nonbinary participant during the current qualifying window can apply for the 2023 boston marathon. entry into the event will be determined by the athlete’s submitted time and the marathon’s overall field size limit. the registration application will include a nonbinary gender option for runners to select.“while we do not currently have qualifying standards for non-binary athletes, we are working on ways non-binary participants are accepted into the event,” the baa said. “discussions are ongoing with non-binary athletes in an effort to further promote inclusion at all baa events.”the baa said that it does not yet have enough data to establish qualifying times specific to nonbinary runners since the 2023 race will be the first to specifically include nonbinary athletes. but the organization encouraged nonbinary runners to use the women’s division qualifying standards this year because they are inclusive of the athletic standards that need to be met in the existing men’s and women’s categories.“as we prepare for future races, participants can expect non-binary times to be updated accordingly,” the association said. “we view this first year as an opportunity to learn and grow together.”nonbinary runners between ages 18 and 34 must have run a qualifying marathon time of 3 hours and 30 minutes or faster from sept. 1, 2021, until now. the qualifying time increases with each age group and allows nonbinary runners to train with specific qualifying times in mind.“personally i’m so excited to know what i need to do to qualify for a bucket-list race, and thrilled that my community of nonbinary runners is being acknowledged by the boston athletic association,” j solle, a nonbinary runner and director at large of queer running club front runners new york, told the 19th.the boston marathon is the latest major race to start adding nonbinary divisions. last year’s philadelphia distance run — which includes a half marathon and a 5k — became the first large race in the country to create a nonbinary division and offer equal prize money. the brooklyn marathon and half marathon followed suit earlier this spring, with 82 registered nonbinary participants among the finishers, according to the associated press. the momentum is largely thanks to nonbinary runners pushing for more inclusivity

city area, was killed in a car crash sunday morning on his way to work at the sept. 11 memorial ceremony in manhattan, according to police officials and his former teams.varvaro, 37, was an officer for the port authority of new york and new jersey. he played baseball at st. john’s university in new york city before a career in the majors as a relief pitcher with the seattle mariners, atlanta braves and boston red sox from 2010 to 2015.“we are deeply saddened on the passing of former braves pitcher anthony varvaro,” the braves said in a statement. “our thoughts and prayers are with his family and colleagues.”the crash happened sunday morning in new jersey. messages seeking details about the crash were left with new jersey state police.st. john’s head baseball coach mike hampton said he was “at a loss for words” over varvaro’s death.“not only was he everything you could want out of a ball player, he was everything you could want in a person,” said hampton, who was an assistant coach at st. john’s during all three of varvaro’s seasons there. “my heart goes out to his family, friends, teammates and fellow officers.”port authority officials said in a statement that varvaro “represented the very best of this agency, and will be remembered for his courage and commitment to service.”“on this solemn occasion as the port authority mourns the loss of 84 employees in the attacks on the world trade center — including 37 members of the port authority police department — our grief only deepens today with the passing of officer varvaro,” said the statement by port authority chairman kevin o’toole and executive director rick cotton.raised in staten island in new york city, varvaro was drafted by seattle in the 12th round in 2005. he played for the mariners in 2010 and atlanta from 2011 to 2014.varvaro was traded to the red sox in late 2014 and pitched 11 innings for boston early in the 2015 season. in may 2015, the chicago cubs claimed him off waivers from boston, but returned him to the red sox after testing showed he had a elbow injury in his right pitching arm, which resulted in season-ending surgery.for his major league career, he pitched 183 innings in 166 games, compiling a 3.23 earned run average, 150 strikeouts and one save.in 2016, he appeared in 18 games for boston’s top minor league affiliate before retiring in june and beginning his police training.varvaro, who studied criminal justice at st. john’s and graduated in 2005, told the student newspaper, the torch, in december 2016 that he inquired about police jobs at the port authority while pitching in the majors.“i figured that i had a pretty successful career in baseball, i had played a number of seasons, and i was fine moving on to the next step of my life,” he told the newspaper.port authority officials said varvaro became a police officer in december 2016 and was assigned to patrol for nearly five years before transferring to the port authority police academy to become an instructor.by entering your email and clicking sign up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners. you are also agreeing to

state of rhode island could be the site of one of the country’s hottest general-election battles in november.langevin has represented rhode island’s 2nd congressional district, which encompasses the state’s more conservative and rural western half, since 2001.president joe biden carried the seat by 14 percentage points in 2020, but the cook political report rated the race for the open seat a “toss up” in june.the contest is expected to be close in no small part because the presumptive republican nominee to replace langevin is former cranston mayor allan fung, a self-described moderate with a history of crossover appeal.democrats in rhode island will decide on tuesday between six candidates to take on fung in the general election: rhode island general treasurer seth magaziner; former langevin aide joy fox; former state rep. david segal; former biden cabinet official sarah morgenthau; refugee activist omar bah; and former state rep. spencer dickinson.fung led all of his potential democratic challengers in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup, according to a public poll conducted in june shortly before the supreme court ruling that overturned the constitutional right to an abortion.“allan fung is not donald trump,” said wendy schiller, a political scientist at brown university. “that’s the big challenge for democrats to hold the seat. can they convince voters that a vote for allan fung is a vote for [house republican leader] kevin mccarthy and a vote for donald trump?”magaziner, who boasts the widest array of endorsements and the largest war chest, is the polling favorite.“even with undecideds, he’s got enough people who are going to affirmatively try to choose him,” schiller said. “and increasingly in the last month, democrats in that district have come to see him as the most competitive against fung. those democrats are persuaded that this seat could give republicans control of the house.”magaziner, who has overseen rhode island’s finances since 2014, has deep roots in democratic politics ― both locally and nationally. magaziner’s father, ira, a successful management consultant, is best known for helming president bill clinton’s unsuccessful health care reform initiative in 1993 and 1994. magaziner credits his family’s wealth for enabling him to lend his first campaign for treasurer more than $800,000.as treasurer, magaziner endeared himself to rhode island’s labor unions with his support for the creation of an infrastructure bank ― and to financial industry donors with his pursuit of aggressive, nontraditional investments for the state’s pension fund. (magaziner maintains that he was simply seeking the best possible returns for retired state employees.)magaziner has also benefited from a head start on fundraising from an abandoned bid for governor that he launched in september 2021. he decided in late january to run for congress instead, following langevin’s announcement that he would be retiring.relieved not to have to choose between magaziner and lt. gov. dan mckee in the gubernatorial race, top democrats, labor unions and other party-aligned groups quickly coalesced behind magaziner’s congressional bid. the league of conservation voters victory fund, an environmental super pac, has spent nearly $400,000 in support of magaziner’s bid. and magaziner stands to benefit from the support of langevin, who endorsed him in june.“it’s time to stop the fighting and get to work.”magaziner is running on a relatively conventional democratic platform. in his tv ads, he has emphasized his support for abortion rights and stricter gun laws, as well as his commitment to protecting social security and medicare.“i’m running for congress because i want to make it easier for working people to get ahead and build a good, stable life,” he declared in a sept. 1 debate.there are signs, however, that magaziner would resemble more business-friendly members of the house democratic caucus, though not quite to the extent of the party’s most conservative outliers. while he has picked up the endorsement of progressive boston mayor michelle wu, he’s also been endorsed by rep. jake auchincloss (d-mass.), a prominent moderate. although magaziner is refusing to accept contributions from political action committees affiliated with the gun, fossil fuel, and pharmaceutical industries, he has not forsworn money from all corporate pacs. and web3 forward, a super pac that advocates for lighter regulation of the cryptocurrency industry, has spent over $162,000 on advertisements supporting magaziner.magaziner has also distinguished himself from his rivals by criticizing biden’s forgiveness of $10,000 in student debt for americans earning under $125,000. he has said he prefers to reduce interest rates on loans, but told huffpost in an interview that he would not vote against biden’s debt cancellation if it were put to a vote in congress and it was the only real reform on the table.“what i’m very concerned about as well is that we fix the underlying structural issues about how higher education is financed, so we don’t end up in the same situation five years from now,” he said.other contenders have made the case that they are more electable against fung than magaziner would be. and in the event of an upset loss for magaziner, democrats will get a chance to test alternative theories of electability in a state where democratic congressional candidates are less accustomed to contentious general elections. sarah morgenthau, a former department of commerce official under biden and department of homeland security official under president barack obama, has raised the second-largest amount of money after magaziner. they are the only two candidates who have been able to advertise on television.morgenthau, whose mother unsuccessfully sought the seat in 1988, is running more than anything on her identity as a woman and the possibility of becoming the first democratic woman to represent rhode island in congress. one of her tv ads features the lyrics “roe, roe, roe, your vote” ― a reference to the overturned roe v. wade decision that created a constitutional right to abortion ― to the tune of “row, row, row your boat.”“it’s time to stop the fighting and get to work,” she told huffpost. “that’s what i’ve been about throughout my life and throughout my career.” morgenthau said she is the candidate best equipped to beat fung because, among other things, she is “coming in with a heck of a lot of experience.”but morgenthau, a granddaughter of the new deal-era treasury secretary henry morgenthau, has considerable baggage. she owns a summer home in rhode island, but only made the state her permanent home recently in order to run for congress. “rhode island has been my home for 40 years,” morgenthau insisted during a recent televised democratic primary debate, noting her mother’s run for congress in the area over three decades ago. “while my heart is here in rhode island, my experience has been everywhere ― and it’s exactly that experience that i will bring to bring back results for folks here in rhode island.”magaziner has a less striking residency problem of his own, having moved into the district from his former home on the east side of providence in order to run in rhode island’s 2nd.magaziner said that his work as treasurer, which included school construction and clean-energy financing plans, have put him in touch with the district’s needs.“i will put my hometown girl against his hometown boy all day long.”“i’ve worked in every city and town in the district to solve problems,” he told huffpost. by contrast, fox ― a political consultant and former local journalist who also worked for former rhode island gov. gina raimondo (d), now the u.s. secretary of commerce ― touts her local ties. a resident of warwick, fox jokes that she doesn’t commute much beyond her family home in cranston, where she and her mother are caring for a father with alzheimer’s disease. “i grew up in the city [fung] was mayor of,” fox said. “i will put my hometown girl against his hometown boy all day long.” fox also noted that she was part of the campaign team that helped raimondo defeat fung in two consecutive gubernatorial races.the challenge for fox is in letting enough democratic voters know she exists, despite her small budget ― and convincing them she’ll be able to scale up in a competitive race come november.“you could envision joy fox beating allan fung with money, because joy fox can use the national theme [of beating republicans] and also claim the mantle of a local rhode islander who was born and raised here,” schiller said.omar bah, a political refugee from gambia who founded a nonprofit that serves refugees in providence, is a long-shot candidate who had raised less than $63,000 as of late august. but he too has an electability case to make, arguing that a failure to nominate him risks ceding a portion of nonwhite voters to fung, with whom they may identify because he has chinese ancestry.“if allan fung goes against seth magaziner or any other white candidate, he will take a large chunk of people of color from the democratic party who otherwise would have voted for me,” bah told huffpost.the policy differences between magaziner, fox, morgenthau and bah are relatively modest ― and not a major focus of their respective bids. dickinson and segal, by contrast, are making an ideological case, albeit from opposite ends of the spectrum. dickinson argues that the democratic party has moved much too far to the left, prompting centrist and conservative voters to leave the party. dickinson has sparse policy material on his campaign website, but he does name “closing” the u.s.-mexico border as his highest priority. “if the president won’t do it, then the congress must,” he declares. “use the army if necessary.”segal, who founded the advocacy group demand progress and is backed by sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.), has carved out the progressive lane in the race, running as a foe of “corporate special interests and political corruption.” segal’s platform includes the standard array of left-wing policies, including support for medicare for all and the green new deal.but segal also emphasizes his record of building bipartisan coalitions for liberal goals like reducing the power of big technology firms and ending u.s. support for the saudi arabia-led invasion of yemen. and he insists that without a populist critique of a rigged economic and political system, democrats are at a disadvantage against fung.“the general election here needs to be taken really seriously,” segal said. “the way to do that is to nominate somebody who has a 20-year record of taking on outsize corporate power. this is a really popular fight.”rhode island has a history of electing democrats with socially conservative tendencies. until recently, many top democrats in the state legislature supported gun rights and restrictions on abortion access.segal nonetheless hopes to appeal to the state’s sizable population of working-class voters, some of whom have shown a receptiveness to a populist message. the state’s democratic primary voters opted for sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) over former secretary of state hillary clinton during the 2016 presidential primary. some of sanders’ biggest margins were in warwick and cranston, key population centers in rhode island’s 2nd. sanders endorsed segal last thursday.“the way to do that is to nominate somebody who has a 20-year record of taking on outsize corporate power. this is a really popular fight.”what segal lacks in tv advertising, he could make up for in grassroots support, which carries greater weight in low-turnout races. segal’s campaign released an internal poll earlier this month that showed him gaining ground on magaziner. and the working families party has since spent more than $87,000 on paid phone banking and digital ads in support of segal’s bid. finally, the mysterious super pac ocean state forward has emerged as a wild card with a last-minute spending spree in the race’s final days. the group, whose funders and agenda are unknown, has spent more than $102,000 on direct-mail literature attacking magaziner.“seth magaziner claims to be a progressive democrat who fights for working families, but he has taken more special interest campaign cash than any candidate for congress,” one mail item alleges.ocean state forward is run by democratic political operative jennifer may. but the attack mirrors the critiques of magaziner that national republicans have already made.“allan fung led the cranston comeback and has proven that one-party rule is hurting rhode islanders whose cost of living has surged with democrats in control,” samantha bullock, a spokesperson for the national republican congressional committee, said in a statement. “there couldn’t be a greater contrast between fung and silver spoon seth magaziner, whose political

election and paint fung as a foot soldier for republican house leader kevin mccarthy (r-calif.). fung gave the party some ammunition when he welcomed mccarthy in person to raise money for him in rhode island in august. he also attended mccarthy’s national gop donor retreat in wyoming later in the month.fung, who opposes late-term abortions and public funding for abortions, has said that restricting abortion would not be a priority for him in congress. “in rhode island, they’ve already spoken about this issue,” fung told the boston globe, referring to the state’s codification of abortion rights

moonshot speech, highlighting biden administration efforts aimed at “ending cancer as we know it.”the president was traveling to boston on monday to draw attention to a new federally backed study that seeks to validate using blood tests to screen against multiple cancers — a potential game-changer in diagnostic testing to dramatically improve early detection of cancers. he also planned other announcements meant to better the lives of those suffering from cancer.his speech at the john f. kennedy presidential library and museum comes as biden seeks to rally the nation around developing treatments and therapeutics for the pervasive diseases that the centers for disease control and prevention rank as the second-highest killer of people in the u.s. after heart disease. biden hopes to move the u.s. closer to the goal he set in february of cutting u.s. cancer fatalities by 50% over the next 25 years and to dramatically improve the lives of caregivers and those suffering from cancer.danielle carnival, the white house cancer moonshot coordinator, told the associated press that the administration sees huge potential in the commencement of the blood diagnostic study on identifying and treating cancers.“one of the most promising technologies has been the development of blood tests that offer the promise of detecting multiple cancers in a single blood test and really imagining the impact that could have on our ability to detect cancer early and in a more equitable way,” carnival said. “we think the best way to get us to the place where those are realized is to really test out the technologies we have today and see what works and what really has an impact on extending lives.”in 2022, the american cancer society estimates, 1.9 million new cancer cases will be diagnosed and 609,360 people will die of cancer diseases.the issue is personal to biden, who lost his adult son beau in 2015 to brain cancer. after beau’s death, congress passed the 21st century cures act, which dedicated $1.8 billion over seven years for cancer research and was signed into law in 2016 by president barack obama.obama designated biden, then vice president, to run “mission control” on directing the cancer funds as a recognition of biden’s grief as a parent and desire to do something about it. biden wrote in his memoir “promise me, dad” that he chose not to run for president in 2016 primarily because of beau’s death.despite biden’s attempts to hark back to kennedy and his space program, the current initiative lacks that same level of budgetary support. the apollo program garnered massive public investment — more than $20 billion, or more than $220 billion in 2022 dollars adjusted for inflation. biden’s “moonshot” effort is far more modest and reliant on private sector investment.still, biden has tried to maintain momentum for investments in public health research, including championing the advanced research projects agency for health, modeled after similar research and development initiatives benefiting the pentagon and intelligence community.on monday, biden will announce dr. renee wegrzyn as the inaugural director of arpa-h, which has been given the task of studying treatments and potential cures for cancers, alzheimer’s, diabetes and other diseases. he will also announce a new national cancer institute scholars’ program to provide resources to early-career scientists studying treatments and cures for cancer.in boston, biden will also attend an event at logan international airport to highlight investments from the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law as well as a fundraiser for the democratic national committee.experts agree it’s far too early to say whether these new blood tests for finding cancer in healthy people will have any effect on cancer deaths. there have been no studies to show they reduce the risk of dying from cancer. still, they say setting an ambitious goal is important.carnival said the national cancer institute study was designed so that any promising diagnostic results could be swiftly put into widespread practice while the longer-term study — expected to last up to a decade — progresses. she said the goal was to move closer to a future where cancers could be detected through routine bloodwork, potentially reducing the need for more invasive and burdensome procedures like colonoscopies, and therefore saving lives.scientists now understand that cancer is not a single disease, but hundreds of diseases that respond differently to different treatments. some cancers have biomarkers that can be targeted by existing drugs that will slow a tumor’s growth. many more targets await discovery.“how do we learn what therapies are effective in which subtypes of disease? that to me is oceanic,” said donald a. berry, a biostatistician at the university of texas m.d. anderson cancer center. “the possibilities are enormous. the challenges are enormous.”despite the challenges, he’s optimistic about cutting the cancer death rate in half over the next 25 years.“we can get to that 50% goal by slowing the disease sufficiently across the various cancers without curing anybody,” berry said. “if i were to bet on whether we will achieve this 50% reduction, i would bet yes.”even without new breakthroughs, progress can be made by making care more equitable, said dr. crystal denlinger, chief scientific officer for the national comprehensive cancer network, a group of elite cancer centers.and any effort to reduce the cancer death rate will need to focus on the biggest cancer killer, which is lung cancer. mostly attributable to smoking, lung cancer now causes more cancer deaths than any other cancer. of the 1,670 daily cancer deaths in the united states, more than 350 are from lung cancer.lung cancer screening is helping. the american cancer society says such screening helped drive down the cancer death rate 32% from its peak in 1991 to 2019, the most recent year for which numbers are available.but only 5% of eligible patients are being screened for lung cancer.“it’s tragic,” said dr. roy herbst, a lung specialist at yale cancer center.“the moonshot is going to have to be a social fix as well as a scientific and medical fix,” herbst said. “we’re going to have to find a way that screening becomes easier, that it’s fully covered, that we have more screening facilities.”biden planned to urge americans who might have delayed cancer screenings during the pandemic to seek them out swiftly, reminding them that early detection can be key to avoiding adverse outcomes.he was also set to highlight provisions in the democrats’ healthcare and climate change bill that the administration believes will lower out of pocket drug prices for some widely used cancer treatments. he will also celebrate new guarantees for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits, that cover their potential cancer diagnoses.dr. michael hassett of dana-farber cancer institute in boston, said biden’s goal to reduce cancer deaths could met by following two parallel paths: one of discovery and the other making sure as many people as possible are reaping the advantages of existing therapies and preventive approaches.“if we can address both aspects, both challenges, major advances are possible,” hassett said.in breast cancer, for example, many women who could benefit from a hormone-blocking pill either never start the therapy or stop taking it before the recommended five years, hassett’s research has found.“those are big gaps,” hassett said. “that’s a treatment that’s effective. but if many people aren’t taking that medication or if they’re taking it but stopping it before concluding the course of therapy, then the benefits that the medicine could offer aren’t realized.”___johnson reported from seattle. do you have information you want to share with huffpost? here’s how.by entering your email and clicking sign up, you're agreeing to let us send you

huffpostthis profile is part of our culture shifters series, which highlights people who are changing the way we think about the world around us. read about film archivist maya cade, internet stars keyon elkins and drew afualo, rapper latashá, music historian katelina eccleston, filmmaker alika tengan, artist kay rufai and actors rhoyle ivy king and nicco annan.ani liu thinks of her body as a tool — and the subject — of artmaking. in her work, the 36-year-old research-based artist visualizes the emotional experiences she underwent at every stage in her life. in early 2020, liu was without childcare for her newborn amid the pandemic while holding on to her full-time job as an artist and a lecturer at princeton university teaching art classes through the lens of gender, social inequality and technology. more than 3 million women either lost jobs or dropped out of the labor force to take care of their children, according to an analysis by the census bureau in spring 2020. the following year, five days after giving birth to her son in august 2021, liu had to get back to work. she did not qualify for parental leave policies or maternity leave policies because she had just started a new contract as an associate professor of practice at the university of pennsylvania stuart weitzman school of design. she had to pump more milk than she directly fed her son. “this was such an interesting moment where technology and humans are deeply integrated. i feel like i was feeding the machine instead of my son,” liu said. “the pump can be very liberating when it allows you to remove your body from your baby and pursue whatever you want. but it can be limiting because the technology assumes that it’s feasible for all women to go back into the labor force when they are not.”these are the kinds of conversations that liu regularly explores in her exhibitions. she has learned how to disguise her art as science through research and experimentation on sex and gender, female empowerment and how technology confronts our cultural values.in her latest exhibition “ecologies of care,” liu showcases a series of pieces discussing the labor of mothering, body and politics. in the piece “labor of love,” she records every feed and diaper change for the first 30 days after giving birth to her daughter and uses vials filled with breast milk, formula or diaper fragments to mark a feed or a diaper change. the sound of a breast pump circulating milk echoes throughout the gallery space. the volume of milk present in “untitled (feeding through space and time)” ranges from the amount produced in a single session of feeding to a month’s supply of lactation.liu said the process of lactation is usually stimulated by looking at a baby’s cute face or hearing the baby crying, but since she was pumping so early, the sound of the pump would make her lactate. this experience inspired her to create the pump artwork and made her question how machines play a role in the postpartum period.liu created another piece in this series called “the surrogacy,” which depicts a pig uterus that is pregnant with human fetuses. it is inspired by aldous huxley’s dystopian novel “brave new world” and feminist writer shulamith firestone’s argument that growing embryos outside of a mother’s body “can free women from the tyranny of reproduction.” liu said that though some societies look at the uterus as factories, she thinks that an artificial womb is never a solution to gender inequality. “i strongly believe that it’s not about technology that can change this issue. there are so many social resources that we could enact, like having paid parental leave or subsidized child care,” liu said. “if you are going to take away women’s rights to abortion and force women to have babies, there should be [additional ways] to help mothers.” as she explores her own body now, liu hopes to create more projects about reproductive bodies and labor rights. “some people may think the idea of art making is really frivolous and extra because you need to have a certain amount of economic stability before you can do art. but i think art is essential to culture.”as a first-generation chinese american immigrant, liu’s parents barely spoke english when they immigrated to the united states in the early 1980s from guangzhou. her father cooked in a chinese restaurant, and her mother cleaned hotel rooms to support the family. growing up in chinatown and the flushing neighborhood in queens, liu was told from an early age that the only way to succeed was to do extremely well in school. liu knew she had to work really hard to get out of poverty.liu genuinely loved school, even though there was a lot of pressure to be the perfect kid. she said learning was an escape from some of the more difficult things she experienced growing up as a chinese american. “strangers would ask me ‘where are you from?’ and when i told them i am from new york city, they will ask ’but where are you really from?’” she said.liu studied sculpture and architecture at dartmouth college and received a master’s degree in architecture at harvard university. in grad school, she found her passion for art through coding. however, she didn’t know any artists within her family’s circle. on top of that, liu’s parents told her that art-making can be dangerous; they had witnessed the cultural revolution in china, where the sociopolitical movement led by chairman mao zedong in 1966 imprisoned many artists.but liu was determined to pursue her art anyway.after graduating from dartmouth college in 2008 during a recession, she stayed at the university and worked as a teaching assistant for the art department, helping facilitate the woodwork and casting studios. she developed her sculpture while being a teaching assistant, proving to her parents that she could still make a living doing what she loves. liu’s upbringing has colored how she thinks about her art and career today. at a photo shoot in flushing in august, liu suddenly became emotional while sitting at the bus stop where she used to spend two hours waiting on her commute. she said she remembered fighting with her parents frequently about why they lived so far away from school. the memories brought on happy tears when she realized how far she had come.“i am really grateful for my parents working so hard to achieve the american dream. there were so many barriers for them to achieve the kind of life they wanted for me,” liu said. “though it was even harder to live as a chinese american in the ’80s, i felt almost no negative emotions when i revisited here today.”liu still remembers the painfully embarrassing moment when she opened her lunchbox in middle school. she always loved the handmade chive dumplings her mother packed for her, but she hated the way they smelled in front of her white classmates — and how they’d react when she ate them. sometimes, all she wanted was a ham and cheese sandwich like everyone else.“until you go to school, you don’t really realize that you’re so othered,” liu told me over a cup of coffee in essex market in new york city’s chinatown.years later, liu’s concern about scents and how they are often racialized turned into a larger conversation. in 2018, she created the “human perfume” project, which takes the essence of her favorite people and objects and turns them into a wearable fragrance that can spur memories. she became interested in the relationship between race, gender and olfaction.“i was really interested in what makes the same smell disgusting to one culture and super pleasurable to another culture,” liu said. “and i was wondering whether through these kinds of sensory forms of communication, [could you] have more empathy or interaction? i was really interested in sensory experiences that were subconscious or subliminal.”for her next projects, liu plans to continue her explorations of breastmilk as a cultural material and experiment with data visualization on a molecular level. she is also designing a new course around care, situated within socially engaged art and design. “untitled (pumping)” will be on view at massart art museum in boston in a show titled ”designing motherhood: things that make and break our births.″ additionally, “the surrogacy” and “untitled (feeding through space and time)” will be on view at an upcoming show at mu hybrid art house in the netherlands. two different editions of “pregnancy menswear” will be on display at the grand opening of the mit museum, as well as the kunstmuseum basel in switzerland.“some people may think the idea of art making is really frivolous and extra because you need to have a certain amount of economic stability before you can do art,” she said. “but i think art is essential to culture.”on assignment for huffpost\n","Text data saved successfully.\n","senior culture reporteroften it’s almost impossible to have a real conversation about a venerable figure amid today’s stan culture — and even sometimes frustratingly discouraged. that’s especially true when it comes to older black icons who paved the way for those who came after them, and whose less comfortable truths are often pushed aside out of respect. but director reginald hudlin’s “sidney,” which explores the life and career of the late sidney poitier, actually has those conversations. it does so unflinchingly and candidly. and it includes a variety of equally respected heroes of black cinema who are compelled to reckon with the full portrait of poitier, a man who both aspired and inspired just as much as he frustrated and disappointed.we rarely ever really talk about that last part. “sidney” implores us anyway. it’s a funny thing too, because for many of us when it was announced that there would be a documentary on poitier, a few questions immediately sprang to mind: will it include his affair with “porgy and bess” co-star diahann carroll, who, like him, was married at the time? will it confront the uncle tom dialogue that rose during the blaxploitation era that was far less compromising about how blackness was portrayed on screen? the answer to both these questions is yes and thankfully so. it’s not about sensationalizing or tarnishing the reputation of a man who burst open the doors of opportunity for black people in hollywood and encouraged his contemporaries to advocate for civil rights with figures like martin luther king jr. rather, it’s about honoring his humanity — every facet of it. hudlin is more than equipped for the job. after all, he jumpstarted his career on the heels of poitier, who intentionally went behind the camera to direct movies by and for black folks like “a piece of the action,” “let’s do it again” and “uptown saturday night” in the ’70s. known for helming black classics like “boomerang” and “house party” in the ’90s, hudlin is likely familiar with the quiet expectation to compromise in a system that usually only celebrates you when you play by its rules. hudlin also has the benefit of retrospection when telling the story of “sidney.” he’s got 30 years in the game and has relevant insight into the system of hollywood today. but he also understands with compassion what it was like years prior for actors like poitier. that’s why so many passages throughout “sidney” feel so honest and empathetic, while also interrogating and sobering. hudlin certainly does more than his due diligence by amassing the full scope of poitier’s life growing up poor in the bahamas through interviews with the actor as well as archival footage of poitier reflecting on his experiences. he ultimately pulled himself up by his bootstraps, moved to harlem, and bet on his immense talent. there he faced and, in a sense, overcame a whole new set of challenges as a young black thespian in relentlessly white spaces. while poitier earned his stripes from performing in black spaces like the american negro theatre, it wasn’t until white hollywood took notice that he became immortalized. that’s a fact that catalyzes a lingering question in “sidney” of where in the zeitgeist black actors belong once they receive white adoration.you don’t find an answer in interviews with some of poitier’s white contemporaries. barbra streisand and robert redford in the film unequivocally admire him for who he was and for whom he tried to be. but you might be able to come up with your own answer to that by watching some of the clips hudlin excavates in the film. poitier is interviewed by a white male journalist in one scene of archival footage— always a white journalist back then — just when his career is taking off about how he got his start. the interviewer brings up the fact that poitier was asked to get rid of his “bad native accent was “bad” to get more work. and how did the actor remedy it? he revealed to the interviewer he taught himself by imitating a white guy he saw on screen. it’s a brief exchange between two men that probably wouldn’t have struck anyone back then because it was expected. but looking back on it now within the story of “sidney,” it says a lot about the landscape through which poitier earned his success — and how he even, perhaps subconsciously, sometimes upheld it. “sidney” also finds poitier’s descendants, those who might honor him the most like halle berry, oprah winfrey, morgan freeman, and spike lee, wrangling with the complexities of his career while also venerating him. because, as we too often forget, both things can be done at once. harry belafonte, one of poitier’s longest friends, who often joined forces with him in the fight for racial justice, doesn’t mince words when talking about their playful professional rivalry (poitier’s career blew up on the night he stepped in as an understudy on stage for belafonte). the two often were up for the same roles but, even more crucially, they disagreed on several political issues that sometimes resulted in them not speaking to each other for years at a time. belafonte is also open about turning down poitier’s role in “the defiant ones,” because his character, an escaped convict, helps his white, racist fellow convict (tony curtis). in response, denzel washington points out something that is not often unacknowledged in these kinds of conversations: opportunity. while poitier stood up for a lot of things and was very outspoken about issues of racism and other injustices in and beyond hollywood, he was also a married father of two with financial obligations. not everyone, as washington says, has multiple forms of income to bring home. while poitier was hustling in hollywood, belafonte was also making money on stage, “dayo-ing.” but poitier was well aware of these conversations about him and his film choices. he still stood behind his decisions, while also recognizing the points people made about them. his earnest response was to start a black production company in the ’70s. but when, how and whether to confront the role of the black image on the screen — especially during his time — was trickier to maneuver. the question of compromise could be asked of any of the black luminaries hudlin spoke to in “sidney” — and for what it’s worth, they’ve all confronted questions about navigating whiteness in hollywood. winfrey even openly acknowledged how some black audiences turned against her for what they saw as catering to white audiences on her hit, self-titled tv show.it’s what helped bond the two figures. there’s a moment when we see a visibly emotional winfrey, who like hudlin is a producer of “sidney,” dissolve into tears over her love for poitier as the camera fixates on her for several seconds. what’s most clear at this moment, though, is how these questions of how blackness shows up, and for whom, in largely white spaces remain as relevant today as ever. there’s even something to be said about the fact that poitier was a black sex symbol, propped up and adored by many black women, yet he left both his first wife and, ultimately, carroll to marry a white woman. “sidney,” bafflingly, doesn’t even acknowledge this aspect of his personal and romantic life. in a film that explores every other complicated subject around poitier and the world in which he thrived, this omission by hudlin and screenwriter jesse james miller seems odd. it’s especially peculiar when you think about it in terms of the long history of black men choosing white romantic partners after gaining success in white spaces.there’s certainly no question of whether poitier loved his widow joanna shimkus. both she and their children, as well as poitier’s children with first wife juanita hardy, are all interviewed in the film and speak highly of his relationship with each of them (with respect to the fact that poitier cheated on hardy with carroll, which understandably devastated her). they say he also encouraged his children to have relationships with each other, and his biracial kids to understand their identities. still, that’s the one area of the film that doesn’t feel complete. but when “sidney” soars, which is most of the time, it is an absolutely satisfying portrait of a man who gave us so much within the confines of a system that was making up new rules for his unprecedented success as he went along, and the complex ways in which he responded to that.“sidney” doesn’t bother to simplify details around poitier’s biography, nor does it try to complicate his story. rather, it honors the very real complexities of the life he lived. “sidney” premiered at the 2022 toronto international film festival, and will be released on apple tv plus on sept. 23. senior culture reporterby entering your email and clicking sign up, you're agreeing to let

the california department of forestry and fire protection, or cal fire.“cooler temperatures and higher humidity assisted with moderating some fire activity,” but higher winds allowed the flames to push to the north and northeast, according to a cal fire incident report sunday.more than 5,800 structures in placer and el dorado counties were under threat and some 11,000 residents of communities including foresthill and georgetown were under evacuation orders.in southern california, cooler temperatures and rain brought respite to firefighters battling the massive fairview fire about 75 miles (121 kilometers) southeast of los angeles after sweltering heat last week.the 44-square-mile (114-square-kilometer) blaze was 45% contained sunday. the fire has destroyed at least 30 homes and other structures in riverside county. two people died while fleeing flames last monday.a helicopter assisting with operations in the fairview fire crashed in a residential backyard while attempting to land at a local airport saturday afternoon, fire officials said. injuries to the pilot and two others were not critical. the southern part of the state welcomed the cooler weekend weather as a tropical storm veered off the pacific coast and faded, helping put an end to blistering temperatures that nearly overwhelmed the state’s electrical grid.thunderstorms and the risk of flooding persisted in mountainous areas of greater los angeles on sunday. but after hurricane kay made landfall in mexico last week it quickly was downgraded and weakened further until it largely disappeared, forecasters said.to the north, remnants of kay caused flooding saturday that stranded about 40 vehicles and closed a stretch of state route 190 in death valley national park. the park was still cleaning up from floods five weeks ago that closed many key roads.in washington state, fire officials were scrambling to secure resources in the battle against a blaze sparked saturday in the remote stevens pass area that sent hikers fleeing and forced evacuations of mountain communities. there was no containment sunday of the bolt creek fire, which had scorched nearly 12 square miles (31 square kilometers) of forestland about an hour and a half east of seattle.“the fire will continue to advance in areas that will be unstaffed. with limited resources, only point protection will be in place while resources continue to mobilize to the fire,” said a sunday morning incident report.california’s mosquito fire has covered a large portion of the northern sierra region with smoke. california health officials urged people in affected areas to stay indoors where possible. organizers of the tour de tahoe canceled the annual 72-mile (115-km) bicycle ride scheduled sunday around lake tahoe because of the heavy smoke from the blaze — more than 50 miles (80 km) away. last year’s ride was canceled because of smoke from another big fire south of tahoe.the mosquito fire’s cause remained under investigation. pacific gas & electric said unspecified “electrical activity” occurred close in time to the report of the fire on tuesday.scientists say climate change has made the west warmer and drier over the last three decades and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive. in the last five years, california has experienced the largest and most destructive fires in state history.and the rest of the west hasn’t been immune. there were at least 18 large fires burning in oregon and washington, leading to evacuations and targeted power outages near portland as the

sept. 11 attacks, taking part in a somber wreath-laying ceremony at the pentagon held under a steady rain and paying tribute to “extraordinary americans” who gave their lives on one of the nation’s darkest days.sunday’s ceremony occurred a little more than a year after biden ended the long and costly war in afghanistan that the u.s. and allies launched in response to the terror attacks.biden noted that even after the united states left afghanistan that his administration continues to pursue those responsible for the 9/11 attacks. last month, biden announced the u.s. had killed ayman al-zawahri, the al-qaida leader who helped plot the sept. 11 attacks, in a clandestine operation.“we will never forget, we will never give up,” biden said. “our commitment to preventing another attack on the united states is without end.”the president was joined by family members of the fallen, first responders who had been at the pentagon on the day of the attack, as well as defense department leadership for the annual moment of tribute carried out in new york city, the pentagon and somerset county, pennsylvania.in ending the afghanistan war, the democratic president followed through on a campaign pledge to bring home u.s. troops from the country’s longest conflict. but the war concluded chaotically in august 2021, when the u.s.-backed afghan government collapsed, a grisly bombing killed 170 afghans and 13 u.s. troops at kabul’s airport, and thousands of desperate afghans gathered in hopes of escape before the final u.s. cargo planes departed over the hindu kush.biden marked the one-year anniversary of the u.s. withdrawal from afghanistan late last month in low-key fashion. he issued a statement in honor of the 13 u.s. troops killed in the bombing at the kabul airport and spoke by phone with u.s. veterans assisting ongoing efforts to resettle in the united states afghans who helped the war effort.biden on sunday said an “incredible debt” was owed to the u.s. troops who served in afghanistan as well as their families. more than 2,200 u.s. service members were killed and more than 20,000 were wounded over the course of the nearly 20-year war, according to the pentagon.he also vowed that the nation will “never fail to meet the sacred obligation to you to properly prepare and equip those that we send into harm’s way and care for those and their families when they come home — and to never, ever, ever forget.”senate minority leader mitch mcconnell on thursday criticized biden’s handling of the end of the war and noted that the country has spiraled downward under renewed taliban rule since the u.s. withdrawal.“now, one year on from last august’s disaster, the devastating scale of the fallout from president biden’s decision has come into sharper focus,” mcconnell said. “afghanistan has become a global pariah. its economy has shrunk by nearly a third. half of its population is now suffering critical levels of food insecurity.”the president also remembered the words of comfort queen elizabeth ii, who died last week, sent to the american people soon after the 2001 attacks: “grief is the price we pay for love.” biden said those words remain as poignant as they did 21 years ago but the weight of loss also remains heavy.“on this day, when the price feels so great, jill and i are holding all of you close to our hearts.” biden said.biden has recently dialed up warnings about what he calls the “extreme ideology” of former president donald trump and his “maga republican” adherents as a threat to american democracy. without naming trump, biden again on sunday raised a call for americans to safeguard democracy.“it’s not enough to stand up for democracy once a year or every now and then,” biden said. “it’s something we have to do every single day. so this is a day not only to remember, but also is a day for renewal and resolve for each and every american in our devotion to this country, to the principles it embodies, to our democracy.”first lady jill biden spoke to a crowd at the flight 93 national memorial observance in shanksville, pennsylvania, where she recalled the concern she had about her sister bonny jacobs, a united airlines flight attendant.she said the attacks showed that “with courage and kindness we can be a light in that darkness.”“it showed us that we are all connected to one another,” said biden, who was joined by her sister in shanksville for sunday’s commemoration. “so as we stand on this sacred and scarred earth, a record of our collective grief and a monument to the memories that live on each day, this is the legacy we much carry forward: hope that defies hate.”vice president kamala harris and her husband attended a commemoration ceremony at the national september 11th memorial in new york. do you have information you want to share with huffpost? here’s how.by entering your email and clicking sign up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our

tributes, and pleas to “never forget,” 21 years after the deadliest terror attack on u.s. soil.bonita mentis set out to read victims’ names at the ground zero ceremony wearing a necklace with a photo of her slain sister, shevonne mentis, a 25-year-old guyanese immigrant who worked for a financial firm.“it’s been 21 years, but it’s not 21 years for us. it seems like just yesterday,” mentis said. “the wounds are still fresh.”“no matter how many years have passed, nobody can actually comprehend that what happened that very day,” she added.victims’ relatives and dignitaries also convened at the other two attack sites, the pentagon and a field in pennsylvania.more than two decades later, sept. 11 remains a point for reflection on the hijacked-plane attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people, reconfigured national security policy and spurred a u.s. “war on terror” worldwide. sunday’s observances, which follow a fraught milestone anniversary last year, come little more than a month after a u.s. drone strike killed a key al-qaida figure who helped plot the 9/11 attacks, ayman al-zawahri.pierre roldan, who lost his cousin carlos lillo, a paramedic, said “we had some form of justice” when a u.s. raid killed osama bin laden in 2011.“now that al-zawahri is gone, at least we’re continuing to get that justice,” roldan said.the sept. 11 attacks also stirred — for a time — a sense of national pride and unity for many, while subjecting muslim americans to years of suspicion and bigotry and engendering debate over the balance between safety and civil liberties. in ways both subtle and plain, the aftermath of 9/11 ripples through american politics and public life to this day.but like some other victims’ relatives, jay saloman fears that americans’ consciousness of 9/11 is receding.“it was a terrorist attack against our country that day. and theoretically, everybody should remember it and, you know, take precautions and watch out,” said saloman, who lost his brother.like a growing number of those who read names at ground zero, firefighter jimmy riches’ namesake nephew wasn’t born yet when his relative died. but the boy took the podium to honor him.“you’re always in my heart. and i know you are watching over me,” he said after reading a portion of the victims’ names.more than 70 of sekou siby’s co-workers perished at windows on the world, the restaurant atop the trade center’s north tower. siby had been scheduled to work that morning until another cook asked him to switch shifts.the ivorian immigrant wrestled with how to comprehend such horror in a country where he’d come looking for a better life. and he found it difficult to form friendships as close as those he’d had at windows on the world. it was too painful, he’d learned, to become attached to people when “you have no control over what’s going to happen to them next.”“every 9/11 is a reminder of what i lost that i can never recover,” siby said in the leadup to the anniversary. he’s now president and ceo of roc united, a restaurant workers’ advocacy group that evolved from a post-9/11 relief center.speaking at the pentagon on sunday, president joe biden recalled seeing smoke rise from the stricken u.s. military headquarters on 9/11, when he was a senator. he vowed that the u.s. would continue working to root out terrorist plots and called on americans to stand up for democracy on days beyond the anniversary.“we have an obligation, a duty, a responsibility to defend, preserve and protect our democracy — the very democracy that guarantees the right to freedom that those terrorists on 9/11 sought to bury in the burning fire, smoke and ash,” the democrat said.first lady jill biden was scheduled to speak in shanksville, pennsylvania, where one of the hijacked planes went down after passengers and crew members tried to storm the cockpit as the hijackers headed for washington. al-qaida conspirators had seized control of the jets to use them as passenger-filled missiles.vice president kamala harris and husband doug emhoff joined the observance at the national sept. 11 memorial in new york, but by tradition, no political figures speak. the observance centers instead on victims’ relatives reading aloud the names of the dead.nikita shah headed there in a t-shirt that bore the de facto epigraph of the annual commemoration — “never forget” — and the name of her slain father, jayesh shah.the family later moved to houston but often returns to new york for the anniversary to be “around people who kind of experienced the same type of grief and the same feelings after 9/11,” said shah. she was 10 when her father was killed.“it took a tragedy to unite us. it should not take another tragedy to unite us again.”readers often add personal remarks that form an alloy of american sentiments about sept. 11 — grief, anger, toughness, appreciation for first responders and the military, appeals to patriotism, hopes for peace, occasional political barbs, and a poignant accounting of the graduations, weddings, births and daily lives that victims have missed.some relatives also lament that a nation which came together — to some extent — after the attacks has since splintered apart. so much so that federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies, which were reshaped to focus on international terrorism after 9/11, now see the threat of domestic violent extremism as equally urgent.“it took a tragedy to unite us. it should not take another tragedy to unite us again,” said andrew colabella, whose cousin, john digiovanni, died in the 1993 bombing world trade center bombing that presaged 9/11.beyond the attack sites, other communities around the country marked the day with candlelight vigils, interfaith services and other commemorations. some americans joined in volunteer projects on a day that is federally recognized as both patriot day and a national day of service and remembrance.by entering your email and clicking

avoid a radiation disaster as fighting rages in the area.the six-reactor zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant lost its outside source of power a week ago after all its power lines were disconnected because of shelling. it was operating in “island mode” for several days, generating electricity for crucial cooling systems from its only remaining operational reactor.that’s considered an unstable way of operating a nuclear plant, which could lead to damage to key equipment including turbines and pumps.nuclear operator energoatom said one of the power lines was restored “to its operational capacity” late saturday, making it possible to run the plant’s safety and other systems on electricity from the power system of ukraine.“therefore, a decision was made to shut down power unit no. 6 and transfer it to the safest state – cold shutdown,” the company said sunday in a statement.energoatom said the risk remains high that outside power is cut again, in which case the plant would have to fire up emergency diesel generators to keep the reactors cool and prevent a nuclear meltdown. the company’s chief told the associated press on thursday that the plant only has diesel fuel for 10 days.the plant, one of the 10 biggest atomic power stations in the world, has been occupied by russian forces since early in the war, which marked its 200th day on sunday. ukraine and russia have blamed each other for shelling around the plant that has damaged the power lines connecting it to the grid.energoatom renewed its appeal for russian forces to leave the zaporizhzhia plant and allow for the creation of a “demilitarized zone” around it.the international atomic energy agency, the u.n. nuclear watchdog that has two experts at the plant, confirmed that external power has been restored there.however, iaea director-general rafael grossi said he remains “gravely concerned about the situation at the plant, which remains in danger as long as any shelling continues.”he added that “consultations have begun on the urgent need to establish a nuclear safety and security protection zone” at the plant.the iaea said it would take 30 hours to bring the sixth reactor to a “cold shutdown state,” but it will still require electricity for its safety systems after that. the agency said work is under way to restore other power lines at the plant, which remains occupied by russian forces but run by ukrainian engineers.also on sunday, french president emmanuel macron urged russian president vladimir putin to withdraw his troops and weapons from the plant and ensure its safety and security in line with iaea recommendations.macron reminded putin in a phone conversation that the “russian occupation of the nuclear plant was the cause for concern over its integrity,” according to a statement from the french presidency.___jon gambrell and hanna ahrirova contributed.___follow ap coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraineby entering your email and clicking

will help better track suspicious surges of gun sales that could be a prelude to a mass shooting. but gun rights advocates have argued that step would unfairly segregate legal gun sales when most sales do not lead to mass shootings.visa said it would adopt the international organization for standardization’s new merchant code for gun sales, which was announced on friday. until friday, gun store sales were considered “general merchandise.”visa’s adoption is significant as the largest payment network, and will likely add pressure for mastercard and american express to adopt the code as well.gun control advocates had gotten significant wins on this front in recent weeks. new york city officials and pension funds had pressured the iso and banks to adopt this code.two of the country’s largest public pension funds, in california and new york, are pressing the country’s largest credit card firms to establish sales codes specifically for firearm-related sales that could flag suspicious purchases or more easily trace how guns and ammo are sold.merchant category codes now exist for almost every kind of purchase, including those made at supermarkets, clothing stores, coffee shops and many other retailers.“when you buy an airline ticket or pay for your groceries, your credit card company has a special code for those retailers. it’s just common sense that we have the same policies in place for gun and ammunition stores,” said new york city mayor eric adams, a former police captain who blames the proliferation of guns for his city’s deadly violence.the city’s comptroller, brad lander, said it made moral and financial sense as a tool to push back against gun violence.“unfortunately, the credit card companies have failed to support this simple, practical, potentially lifesaving tool. the time has come for them to do so,” lander said recently, before visa’s announcement.landers is a trustee of the new york city employees’ retirement system, teachers’ retirement system and board of education retirement system — which together own 667,200 shares in american express valued at approximately $92.49 million; 1.1 million shares in mastercard valued at approximately $347.59 million; and 1.85 million shares in visa valued at approximately $363.86 million.in letters to the companies, the new york pensions funds, joined by the california state teachers’ retirement system, sought support for such a move, saying the companies have a responsibility to prohibit the use of their networks for what public officials deemed illegal activity.“failing to do so can result in regulatory, reputational, and litigation risks that may harm long-term shareholder value,” the letters asserted.over the years, public pension funds have used their extensive investment portfolios to influence public policy and the market place.the california teacher’s fund, the second largest pension fund in the country, has long taken aim on the gun industry. it has divested its holdings from gun manufacturers and has sought to persuade some retailers from selling guns.four years ago, the teacher’s fund made guns a key initiative. it called for background checks and called on retailers “monitor irregularities at the point of sale, to record all firearm sales, to audit firearms inventory on a regular basis, and to proactively assist law enforcement.”the pension funds argue that creating a merchant category code for standalone firearm and ammunition stores could aid in the battle against gun violence.in letters to the credit card companies, a pattern of purchases could flag suspicious activity.officials said that a week before the mass shooting at the pulse nightclub in orlando, florida, where 49 people died after a shooter opened fire in 2016, the assailant used credit cards to purchase more than $26,000 worth of guns and ammunition, including purchases at a stand-alone gun retailer.___associated press writer bobby calvan in new york

independent arbiter in the investigation into top-secret documents found at the former president’s florida home, but the two sides differed on the scope of duties the person would have.lawyers for trump said they believe the so-called special master should review all documents seized by the fbi during its search last month of mar-a-lago, including records with classification markings, and filter out any that may be protected by claims of executive privilege.the justice department said it does not believe the arbiter should be permitted to inspect classified records or to take into account potential claims of executive privilege.u.s. district judge aileen cannon had given both sides until friday to submit potential candidates for the role of a special master, as well as proposals for the scope of the person’s duties and the schedule for his or her work.the justice department submitted the names of two retired judges — barbara jones, who served on the federal bench in manhattan and performed the same role in prior high-profile investigations, and thomas griffith, a former federal appeals court jurist in the district of columbia.the trump team proposed one retired judge, raymond dearie — also the former top federal prosecutor in the eastern district of new york — and prominent florida lawyer paul huck jr.the back-and-forth over the special master is playing out amid an fbi investigation into the retention of several hundred classified documents recovered from mar-a-lago within the past year. though the legal wrangling is unlikely to have major long-term effects on the criminal investigation or knock it significantly off course, it will almost certainly delay it and has already caused the intelligence community to temporarily pause a national risk assessment.over the strenuous objections of the justice department, cannon on monday granted the trump team’s request for the special master and directed the department to temporarily halt its review of records for investigative purposes.she said the person would be responsible for sifting through the records recovered during the aug. 8 search of mar-a-lago and filtering out any documents potentially covered by claims of attorney-client or executive privilege.roughly 11,000 documents — including more than 100 with classified markings, some at the top-secret level — were recovered during the search. that’s on top of classified documents contained in 15 boxes retrieved in january by the national archives and records administration, and additional sensitive government records the department took back during a june visit to mar-a-lago.the justice department had objected to the trump team’s request for a special master, saying it had already completed its own review in which identified a limited subset of records that possibly involve attorney-client privilege. it has maintained that executive privilege does not apply in this investigation because trump, no longer president, had no right to claim the documents as his.the department on thursday filed a notice of appeal indicating that it would contest the judge’s order to the 11th u.s. circuit court of appeals in atlanta. officials asked the judge to lift her hold on their investigative work pending their appeal, as well as her requirement that the department share with a special master the classified records that were recovered.it is not clear whether trump or anyone else will be charged.this is a developing story. please check back for updates. do you have information you want to share with

announced saturday that it’s pulling back troops from two areas in ukraine’s eastern kharkiv region where a ukrainian counteroffensive has made significant advances in the past week.the news came after days of apparent advances by ukraine south of kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city, in what could become the biggest battlefield success for ukrainian forces since they thwarted a russian attempt to seize the capital of kyiv at the start of the nearly seven-month war.russian defense ministry spokesman igor konashenkov said saturday that troops would be regrouped from the balakliya and izyum areas to ukraine’s tern donetsk region. izyum was a major base for russian forces in the kharkiv region and earlier this week social media videos showed residents of balakliya joyfully cheering as ukrainian troops moved in.konashenkov said the russian move is being made “in order to achieve the stated goals of the special military operation to liberate donbas,’” one of the eastern ukraine regions that russia has declared sovereign.the claim of pullback to concentrate on donetsk is similar to the justification russia gave for pulling back its forces from the kyiv region earlier this year when they failed to take the ukrainian capital.ukrainian officials earlier saturday claimed major gains in a counteroffensive against russian forces in the kharkiv region, saying ukrainian troops had cut off vital supplies to izyum.ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman oleh nikolenko also suggested the ukrainian troops had retaken kupiansk, a town along the main supply route to izyum, long a focus on the russian front line and the site of heavy artillery and other fighting. nikolenko tweeted a photo showing soldiers in front of what he said was a government building in kupiansk, 73 kilometers (45 miles) north of izyum.the ukrainian security service of ukraine hours later posted a message which it said showed its forces in kupiansk, further suggesting it had been seized by ukrainian troops. the ukrainian military didn’t immediately confirm entering the town, a railway hub that russia seized in february.videos on social media appeared to show ukrainian forces on the outskirts of izyum at a roadside checkpoint. a large statue with the city’s name could be seen in the footage. ukrainian forces did not acknowledge holding the city.earlier saturday, the british defense ministry told reporters it believed the ukrainians had advanced as much as 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of kharkiv, and described russian forces around izyum as “increasingly isolated.”“russian forces were likely taken by surprise. the sector was only lightly held and ukrainian units have captured or surrounded several towns,” the british military said, adding that the loss of kupiansk would greatly affect russian supply lines.the institute for the study of war, a washington-based think tank, likewise referenced sweeping ukrainian gains, estimating that kyiv has seized around 2,500 square kilometers (965 square miles) in its eastern breakthrough. the institute said it appeared that “disorganized russian forces (were) caught in the rapid ukrainian advance.” they cited social media images of apparent russian prisoners seized in the advance around izyum and surrounding towns.the same report said ukrainian forces “may collapse russian positions around izyum if they sever russian ground lines of communication” north and south of the town.vladislav sokolov, head of the russian-appointed local administration, said on social media that authorities in izyum have started evacuating residents to russia.the fighting in eastern ukraine comes amid an ongoing offensive around kherson in the south. analysts suggest russia may have taken soldiers from the east to reinforce around kherson, offering the ukrainians the opportunity to strike a weakened front line.ukrainian defense minister oleksii reznikov told the television channel ukraina that the russians had no food or fuel for their troops in the area as kyiv had cut off their supply lines.“it will be like an avalanche,” he said, predicting a russian fallback. “one line of defense will shake and it will fall.”the ukrainian military was more circumspect about the reported gains, claiming saturday to have taken “more than 1,000 square kilometers” (386 square miles) from pro-kremlin forces this week. it said “in some areas, units of the defense forces have penetrated the enemy’s defenses to a depth of 50 kilometers,” matching the british assessment, but did not disclose geographical details.officials in kyiv have for weeks been tight-lipped about plans for a counteroffensive to retake territory overrun by russia early in the war, urging residents to refrain from sharing information on social media.however, ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy said friday that ukrainian troops had reclaimed more than 30 settlements in the kharkiv region since the start of the counteroffensive.“we are gradually taking control over more settlements, returning the ukrainian flag and protection for our people,” zelenskyy said.he spoke after the ukrainian governor of kharkiv reported that the national flag had been raised over balakliya, a town recaptured by ukrainian troops on thursday following six months of russian occupation.“balakliya is ukraine! today, together with the military, led by the commander of the ground forces oleksandr syrskyy, we raised the ukrainian flag,” governor oleh syniehubov wrote on telegram.elsewhere, ukrainian emergency services reported that a 62-year-old woman was killed in a russian missile strike in the kharkiv region when her home was flattened overnight.syniehubov also accused moscow of pummeling settlements retaken by kyiv. he said in a telegram post that five civilians were hospitalized in the izyum district, while nine others suffered injuries elsewhere in the region.in the embattled donbas region south of kharkiv, the ukrainian governor said civilians were killed and wounded overnight by russian shelling near the city of bakhmut, a key target of the stalled russian offensive there. pavlo kyrylenko said on telegram that two people died and two more suffered injuries in bakhmut and the neighboring village of yahidne.meanwhile, german foreign minister annalena baerbock arrived in kyiv on an unannounced visit saturday, saying that europe would not tire of helping ukraine despite russian president vladimir putin’s efforts to raise the pressure by withholding energy supplies from european union nations.baerbock said germany will assist ukraine in finding and removing mines and other unexploded ordnance left by russian troops in areas where they have been pushed back by ukrainian forces.despite the gains made by ukraine’s armed forces, u.s. secretary of state antony blinken and the head of nato warned friday that ukraine’s fight against russia appears set to drag on for months. blinken said the war was entering a critical period and urged ukraine’s western backers to keep up their support through what could be a difficult winter.kozlowska reported from london.

winds from a tropical storm friday that brought high humidity, rain and possible flooding to the parched region but also the promise of cooler temperatures after a 10-day heat wave that nearly overwhelmed the state’s electrical grid.firefighters had feared powerful winds that topped 100 mph (161 kph) could expand the massive fairview fire burning about 75 miles (121 kilometers) southeast of los angeles but instead crews made significant progress and pegged monday as a day when they should have full containment. more than 10,000 homes and other structures remained threatened and evacuation orders were still in place.hurricane kay made landfall near mexico’s bahia asuncion in baja california sur state thursday, but it quickly weakened into a tropical storm by the time it reached southern california. still winds, were ferocious in places — speeds reached 109 mph (175 kph) on san diego county’s cuyamaca peak, the national weather service said.the tropical conditions added a swelter to the heat wave that saw temperatures soar past 100 degrees fahrenheit (38 degrees celsius) in many parts of california this week. even places like san diego, renowned for its temperate climate, baked in the heat.by late morning friday a steady rain pelted downtown san diego as charles jenkins swept the accumulating puddles away from the tarps of his makeshift home.“the heat was killer, so for now this feels good,” jenkins said. “i just hope the water doesn’t get too high. but i will rough it. i’ve got pallets i can put underneath to keep out the rain.”around 1 p.m. as rain continued, a navy-contracted, twin-engine plane carrying two civilian pilots slid off the end of a runway after it touched down at naval air station north island in coronado and parked in a spit of sand. the plane’s nose was damaged but the pilots were able to depart on their own and were taken to a hospital for observation, naval base coronado spokesperson kevin dixon said.though rainfall generally was moderate across southern california friday there was a chance of isolated thunderstorms and heavy downpours into saturday. with flooding possible, officials in coastal cities posted warning signs in low-lying areas and made sandbags available to the public.september already has produced one of the hottest and longest heat waves on record for california and some other western states. nearly 54 million people were under heat warnings and advisories across the region this week as temperature records were shattered in many areas.california’s state capital of sacramento hit an all-time high tuesday of 116 degrees (46.7 c), breaking a 97-year-old record. salt lake city tied its all-time high temperature wednesday at 107 degrees (41.6 c).on tuesday, as air conditioners whirred amid the stifling heat, california set a record for power consumption and authorities nearly instituted rolling blackouts when the electrical grid capacity was at its breaking point.scientists say climate change has made the west warmer and drier over the last three decades and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive. in the last five years, california has experienced the largest and most destructive fires in state history.while firefighters made progress against the fairview fire, the fast-moving mosquito fire in the foothills east of sacramento doubled in size friday to at least 46 square miles (119 square kilometers) and threatened 3,600 homes in placer and el dorado counties, while blanketing the region in smoke.flames jumped the american river, burning structures in the mountain hamlet of volcanoville and moving closer to the towns of foresthill, home to about 1,500 people, and georgetown, population 3,000. more than 5,700 people in the area have been evacuated, said placer county sheriff’s office lt. josh barnhart.david hance slept on the porch of his mother’s foresthill mobile home when he woke up to a glowing red sky early wednesday morning and was ordered to evacuate.“it was actually fricking terrifying, cause they say, ‘oh yeah, it’s coming closer,’” he said. “it was like sunset in the middle of the night.”hance left behind most of his electronic gear, all his clothing and family photos and fled to auburn, where he found his mother, linda hance, who said the biggest stress is wondering: “is my house still there?”organizers of the tour de tahoe announced friday they were canceling the annual 72-mile (115-km) bicycle ride scheduled sunday around lake tahoe because of the heavy smoke from the blaze — more than 50 miles (80 km) away — and noted that cycling is a “heavy cardio activity that does not pair well with terrible air quality.” last year’s ride was canceled due

their counteroffensive against russian forces in the country's east, taking control of a sizeable village and pushing toward an important transport junction. the united states' top diplomat and the head of nato noted the advances, but cautioned that the war is likely to drag on for months.ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy commended the military for its gains in the east, saying in a nightly video address that ukrainian troops have reclaimed more than 30 settlements in the kharkiv region since the start of the counteroffensive there this week.“we are gradually taking control over more settlements, returning the ukrainian flag and protection for our people.” zelenskyy said.ukraine's military said it also launched new attacks on russian pontoon bridges used to bring supplies across the dnieper river to kherson, one of the largest russian-occupied cities, and the adjacent region. ukrainian artillery and rocket strikes have left all regular bridges across the river unusable, the military's southern command said.anxiety increased about europe's largest nuclear power plant, which was operating in emergency mode friday for the fifth straight day due to the war. that prompted the head of the u.n. atomic watchdog to call for the establishment of an immediate safety zone around the plant to prevent a nuclear accident.the six-reactor zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant came under the control of russian forces early in the war but is being operated by ukrainian staff. the plant and surrounding areas have been repeatedly hit by shelling that russia and ukraine blame on each other. the last power line connecting the plant to the ukrainian electricity grid was cut monday, leaving the plant without an outside source of electricity. it is receiving power for its own safety systems from the only reactor — out of six total — that remains operational.in other advances, the ukrainian military said it took control of the village of volokhiv yar in the kharkiv region and aimed to advance toward strategically valuable town of kupiansk, which would cut off russian forces from key supply routes.pro-russian authorities in the kupiansk district announced that civilians were being evacuated toward the russian-held region of luhansk. “the initial signs are positive and we see ukraine making real, demonstrable progress in a deliberate way,” u.s. secretary of state antony blinken said in brussels, a day after visiting kyiv. “but this is likely to go on for some significant period of time,” he said. “there are a huge number of russian forces in ukraine and unfortunately, tragically, horrifically, president (vladimir) putin has demonstrated that he will throw a lot of people into this at huge cost to russia.”nato secretary-general jens stoltenberg, who met with blinken, said the war is “entering a critical phase.”the gains \"are modest and only the first successes of the counteroffensive of the ukrainian army, but they are important both in terms of seizing the military initiative and raising the spirit of ukrainian soldiers,” mykola sunhurovskyi, a military analyst at the razumkov center in kyiv, told the associated press.energoatom, ukraine's state nuclear operator, said friday that repairs to outside electric lines at the zaporizhzhia plant are impossible because of the shelling and that operating the plant in what is called an “island” status carries \"the risk of violating radiation and fire safety standards.”\"only the withdrawal of the russians from the plant and the creation of a security zone around it can normalize the situation at the zaporizhzhia npp. only then will the world be able to exhale,” petro kotin, the head of energoatom, told ukrainian tv. earlier, kotin told the associated press the plant's only operating reactor “can be stopped completely\" at any moment and as a consequence, the only power source would be a diesel generator. there are 20 generators on site and enough diesel fuel for 10 days. after that, about 200 tons of diesel fuel would be needed daily for the generators, which he said is “impossible” to get while the plant is occupied by russian forces.rafael mariano grossi, the director of the international atomic energy agency, said friday that there was little likelihood of reestablishing reliable offsite power lines to the plant.“this is an unsustainable situation and is becoming increasingly precarious,” grossi said, calling for an “immediate cessation of all shelling in the entire area” and the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone.“this is the only way to ensure that we do not face a nuclear accident,” he said.fighting continued friday elsewhere in ukraine.russian planes bombed the hospital in the town of velika pysarivka, on the border with russia, said dmytro zhyvytskyi, governor of the sumy region. he said the building was destroyed and there were an unknown number of casualties.in the donetsk region in the east — one of two that russia declared to be sovereign states at the outset of the war — eight people were killed in the city of bakhmut over the past day and the city is without water and electricity for the fourth straight day, said governor pavlo kyrylenko. four people were killed in shelling in the kharkiv region, two of them in the city of kharkiv, ukraine's second-largest, according to governor oleh syniehubov. the shelling of the city continued friday afternoon, mayor ihor terekhov said, wounding 10 people, including three children. ukraine this week claimed to have regained control of more than 20 settlements in the kharkiv region, including the small city of balakliya. social media posts showed weeping, smiling balakliya residents embracing ukrainian soldiers. kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov on friday refused to comment on the alleged retaking of balakliya, redirecting all such questions to the russian defense ministry. but vitaly ganchev, the russian-installed official in the kharkiv region, confirmed friday that “balakliya, in effect, is not under our control.” ganchev said “tough battles” were continuing in the city.helicopters and fighter jets streaked over the rolling plains of the donetsk region, with the jets heading toward izium, near where ukrainian forces have been carrying out a counteroffensive in the kharkiv region. the jets fired flares and black smoke billowed in the distance.— associated press writer elena becatoros in the donetsk region, ukraine, and frank jordans in berlin contributed to this report. ___follow all ap stories on the war in

and a grueling concert residency, but he still found time to honor his homeland’s late monarch, queen elizabeth ii, with an emotional tribute. the british pop star paused his concert at new york’s madison square garden thursday to acknowledge the queen, who died earlier that day at age 96. “there’s some very sad news today: the passing of queen elizabeth ii,” styles told the crowd, as seen in footage shared by iheart radio. “please join me in a round of applause for 70 years of service.”a post shared by iheartradio (@iheartradio)styles, who was born in redditch, england, has dominated global headlines this week. in addition to his sold-out “harry’s house” concert residency, he’s set to appear on the big screen alongside chris pine and florence pugh in “don’t worry darling,” which hits theaters later this month. “don’t worry darling” premiered to major fanfare at the 2022 venice film festival in italy earlier this week, but its rollout has been anything but smooth.olivia wilde, the film’s director and styles’ girlfriend, has repeatedly attempted to shut down rumors of a behind-the-scenes fallout between her and pugh. however, pugh was noticeably absent from a press conference that preceded the venice screening and won’t be attending the movie’s new york premiere, set to take place sept. 19. as for styles, he was the subject of heated online debate this week after a video that appeared to show him spitting on pine went viral online. pine’s representative has since dismissed the claim, while styles himself poked fun at the footage at a wednesday concert. whether “don’t worry darling” succeeds critically and commercially remains to be seen. however, styles will get another opportunity to prove his thespian chops when he appears in the romantic drama “my policeman,” due out in october. senior culture reporter, huffpostby entering your email and clicking sign up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our

the singer’s federal trial in chicago expressed doubts on the witness stand thursday about kelly’s insistence in the 2000s that he never sexually abused minors — testifying a day after the former employee told jurors he had had no reason to doubt his boss was telling the truth.derrell mcdavid’s testimony, which could be a major blow to kelly’s hope of acquittal, came at the end mcdavid’s second day on the stand. he and the grammy winner are charged with successfully fixing kelly’s 2008 child pornography trial by threatening witnesses and concealing video evidence. both also face child pornography charges.asked by his own lawyer, beau brindley, if he was in “a different position” now as far as assessing allegations against kelly after sitting through government testimony by four kelly accusers, mcdavid responded solemnly: “yes, i am.”“the last (few) weeks … i’ve learned a lot … that i had no idea about in 2008,” he said. when he added that, “as i stand here today, i’m embarrassed… sad,” kelly’s lead lawyer, jennifer bonjean, objected. judge harry leinenweber sustained her objection.mcdavid, who said earlier he once saw kelly as a son, was also asked thursday if he had wanted to believe kelly in the 2000s and through to the end of kelly’s 2008 trial.“i absolutely did,” he answered, “because i loved him and i believed in him.”it is in mcdavid’s interest to say he believed kelly in much of the 2000s because it undermines the government’s case that mcdavid knew kelly was guilty heading into the 2008 trial and would, if evidence wasn’t suppressed, be convicted.with jurors out of the courtroom earlier, bonjean said she was worried mcdavid would — as he ended up doing — cast doubt about kelly’s believability. she said it would unfairly prejudice her client in jurors’ eyes and, on some counts, seal his fate.kelly’s defense team has several times asked that kelly’s trial be severed from mcdavid’s and that kelly be tried alone, saying their interests at a joint trial would inevitably conflict. leinenweber has repeatedly rejected that request.among the charges only kelly faces at the current trial are five counts of enticing minor girls for sex — one count for five kelly accusers. mcdavid’s testimony toward the end of the day thursday could potentially lend credence to those accusations.prosecutors are set to start what could be a blistering cross-examination of mcdavid on friday. mcdavid’s lengthy testimony seemed to open doors for prosecutors to ask him about otherwise barred topics, including evidence entered by state prosecutors at kelly’s 2008 trial.earlier thursday, mcdavid also testified that a push to recover purported kelly sex videos prior to the 2008 trial was driven, not by himself or kelly, but by kelly’s now deceased-criminal lawyer, ed genson.with that testimony, mcdavid sought to distance himself from decisions to aggressively pursue videos prior to the 2008 trial, including by offering six-figure payoffs for lost or stolen videos.the ongoing trial in kelly’s hometown is, in ways , a do-over of that 2008 trial. a single video, which state prosecutors said showed kelly sexually abusing a girl of around 14, was at the heart of that trial. the same video is in evidence at the current trial.the girl in the video, then an adult, did not testify at that 2008 trial, which jurors said at the time was one reason they couldn’t convict kelly. she did testify at the current trial under the pseudonym, “jane.”the otherwise dry, matter-of-fact mcdavid sounded emotional for the first time in two days on the stand when asked thursday how he felt when jurors at the 2008 trial acquitted kelly on all charges.“i was happy,” he said, his voice appearing to break.during one lunch break during mcdavid’s testimony, mcdavid stood next to kelly sitting at his defense table — the two chatting amiably.on thursday, mcdavid told jurors he and kelly began to grow apart in the years after the 2008 trial, friction between them highlighted by financial disputes. he quit working for kelly in 2014, he testified.on wednesday, mcdavid told jurors he had seen jane when she was a minor hanging around kelly’s studio in the late 1990s. he said kelly angrily denied rumors he was sexually abusing jane, who kelly described as his god daughter.“i believed him,” mcdavid testified.testifying earlier, jane, now 37, said kelly sexually abused her hundreds of time starting when she was 14. she also said she was the girl in the video at the center of the 2008 trial and entered as evidence at the current trial. she said kelly produced it.mcdavid is the only one of the three defendants testifying in his own behalf. both kelly and milton brown, the third co-defendant, told the trial judge last week they would not testify.this trial follows a separate federal trial in new york, where the 55-year-old kelly was sentenced to 30 years in june.by entering your email and clicking sign up, you're agreeing to let

pakistan “massive” help in recovering from devastating floods because other nations have contributed much more to climate change, which experts say may have helped trigger the deluge.months of monsoons and flooding have killed 1,391 people and affected 3.3 million in this south asian nation while half a million people have become homeless. planeloads of aid from the united states, the united arab emirates and other countries have begun arriving, but there’s more to be done, guterres said.nature, the u.n. chief said in islamabad, has attacked pakistan, which contributes less than 1% of global emissions, according to multiple experts. nations that “are more responsible for climate change ... should have faced this challenge,” guterres said, seated next to pakistani prime minister shehbaz sharif.“we are heading into a disaster,” guterres added. “we have waged war on nature and nature is tracking back and striking back in a devastating way. today in pakistan, tomorrow in any of your countries.”the u.n. chief’s trip comes less than two weeks after guterres appealed for $160 million in emergency funding to help those affected by the monsoon rains and floods that pakistan says have caused at least $10 billion in damages. on friday, the first planeload arrived from the u.s. , which washington says is part of an upcoming $30 million in assistance.“i appeal for massive support from the international community as pakistan responds to this climate catastrophe,” guterres tweeted after landing in pakistan earlier friday.i have arrived in pakistan to express my deep solidarity

contributing to climate change are obligated to reduce emissions and help pakistan. he assured sharif that his voice was “entirely at the service of the pakistani government and the pakistani people” and that “the entire u.n. system is at the service of pakistan.”“pakistan has not contributed in a meaningful way to climate change, the level of emissions in this country is relatively low,” guterres said. “but pakistan is one of the most dramatically impacted countries by climate change.”later, guterres directed his words to the international community, saying that by some estimates, pakistan needs about $30 billion to recover.so far, u.n. agencies and several countries have sent nearly 60 planeloads of aid, and authorities say the uae has been one of the most generous contributors and sent so far 26 flights carrying aid for flood victims.also friday, samantha power, the administrator of usaid, met with pakistan’s foreign minister bilawal bhutto zardari in islamabad.arrived in

police said thursday that they have connected the dna of a county official to the recent murder of investigative journalist jeff german, whose coverage of alleged misconduct ultimately contributed to the official losing his primary election this summer.at a news conference, clark county sheriff joe lombardo said that clark county public administrator robert telles was arrested at his las vegas home and booked wednesday night on a charge of murder with a deadly weapon. the 45-year-old democrat was taken out of his home on a stretcher with what police said were self-inflicted wounds that were not life-threatening.telles, 45, is accused of stabbing the las vegas review-journal reporter to death. police said that they found german’s body on saturday morning outside of the reporter’s house and that he was likely killed friday morning.“this has been an unusual case from the beginning, the murder of an investigative journalist and the main suspect an elected official here in clark county,” lombardo said. “this is a terrible and jarring homicide, one that has deeply impacted las vegas. every murder is tragic, but the killing of a journalist is particularly troublesome.”dori koren, captain of the las vegas metropolitan police’s homicide division, said that a man was documented on surveillance images walking toward german’s home on friday and then to the side of his house. the man was wearing a straw hat, a bright orange long-sleeved shirt and gray sneakers, and was carrying a duffel bag. when german exited his house through the garage door and went to the side of the house, the intruder got into an altercation with him and the journalist was stabbed multiple times.police identified a vehicle seen driving around german’s neighborhood on the morning of the murder, prior to the murder and at the time of the murder. koren also said that the man described by police had fled in that vehicle, a maroon gmc yukon denali suv with chrome handles, a sunroof and a luggage rack.telles became a person of interest because of his publicly expressed hatred toward the 69-year-old journalist and because a vehicle matching the description of the killer’s car was parked in front of his home. video evidence showed the car leaving telles’ home the morning of the homicide and arriving back shortly after the estimated time of the death. police say they discovered telles was driving the car that morning.when law enforcement searched telles’ home, vehicles and body, they said they found a pair of shoes matching the killer’s clothing, splattered with blood and cut “likely in a manner to destroy evidence.” police also said they recovered a straw hat matching the description, cut in a similar manner.(2/3) telles was taken into custody on september 7, 2022 and is currently at the clark county detention center. he has been charged with open murder with a deadly weapon. click below for previously released photos of the suspect and vehicle. pic.twitter.com/cgnw1xlf8d“one of the most important aspects of this investigation was waiting on the dna results, and we received positive dna results that showed robert telles’ dna at the crime scene,” koren said.lombardo said that police have not yet recovered a weapon but that the investigation is still active. telles voluntarily was interviewed by police and chose not to retain a lawyer, according to the las vegas police department. he is being held at the clark county detention center.“jeff was a loving and loyal brother, uncle and friend who devoted his life to his work exposing wrongdoing in las vegas and beyond. we’re shocked, saddened and angry about his death,” german’s family said in a statement obtained thursday by the review-journal. “jeff was committed to seeking justice for others and would appreciate the hard work by local police and journalists in pursuing his killer. we look forward to seeing justice done in this case,” the statement said. “we also want to thank everyone for the outpouring of love, support and recognition for jeff and his life’s work.”german was a tenacious reporter who covered crime, courts, government corruption and mob figures for decades in las vegas. the journalist had launched a months-long investigation this year into telles’ office, which included allegations of abuses and an inappropriate relationship with an employee.german’s investigation into the potential wrongdoing led to public outrage by telles, who regularly tweeted his anger at the reporter. after a series of stories on telles, the official lost his reelection bid in the june primary.according to police, telles was likely also upset that german was conducting additional reporting on the official. the journalist recently filed public records requests for emails and texts between telles and three other county officials ― one of whom was identified in previous stories as the employee telles allegedly had a relationship with, according to the review-journal.“the death of jeff german was both shocking and tragic, and we join with our community in being stunned at how this situation has continued to evolve over the last few days,” county spokesperson stacey welling said in a statement. “clark county continues to cooperate with the lvmpd on this active investigation. our condolences are with jeff german’s family, friends, and colleagues at the review-journal.”the county said it is “reviewing its options under the law regarding” telles’ position as the public administrator, which is an elected office. the county has suspended telles’ access to county offices and property for “the safety of our county employees and the public” and said that employees of the administrator’s office are working remotely while the office remains closed “until a determination is made about when it can open.”“when county management was made aware of the personnel issues at the public administrator’s office a couple of months ago, the decision was made to no longer have staff in the public administrator’s office report to mr. telles and this solution will be in place until the public elects a new public administrator in november,” welling said.lombardo said thursday that it was an “inappropriate venue to speculate or opine on” whether german’s death is part of a nationwide normalization of violence against

on her journey growing up as a black girl on the south side of chicago.“too often in this country, people feel like they have to look a certain way or act a certain way to fit in,” she went on to say,

reedus suffered a concussion while filming the series finale of “the walking dead” in march, his publicist told ew he was “recovering well” ― but in a new interview he said the injury left him in fear for his life and was far worse than the public knew.“oh dude, that was horrible,” reedus told ew. “that whole ordeal for me personally was terrifying. i thought i was going to die.”details about how the injury occurred have not been released.just like his survivalist “walking dead” character daryl dixon, reedus knows how to forge ahead. the actor has endured his fair share of injuries across 11 seasons of the hit amc show, which will end in november. he once fell off a motorcycle, for instance, and cut his hand on a prop.on march 11, however, reedus suffered a concussion so bad he had to be hospitalized for weeks. details of the incident remained sparse and suggested reedus was simply taking his time to recover. the actor himself, many of whose scenes were finished by a stand-in, now begs to differ.“it was very serious,” reedus told ew. “it was scary. i’ve been hit in the face and the head a million times. i’ve gone through car windows, but that one rung my bell.”“i had a neurologist. i had all sorts of shit,” reedus added. “i failed the light test. i had a security guard in the driveway, just in case. i was holding onto the walls walking through the rooms. it was nuts.”reedus has indeed gone through a car window before. struck by an 18-wheeler in 2005 after an r.e.m. concert in berlin, he required surgery for a new titanium eye socket and four screws in his nose. at the time, reedus was convinced his career was over.cast in one of the most successful tv shows of all time a few years later, however, reedus has more than bounced back. while his concussion weeks before wrapping the finale started a long road to recovery, he was ultimately more concerned about his work ethic.“you’re shooting over a year, and now we’re having to postpone some of the shooting because i’m lying in bed,” reedus told ew. “so the guilt of me not being at work and people are like, ‘are we going to go a week over? are we going two weeks over’ — that was bothering

on the november ballot, thanks to the state’s supreme court.the proposal would amend michigan’s constitution, codifying an array of reproductive rights that are currently in jeopardy thanks to this summer’s u.s. supreme court decision overruling roe v. wade.with roe no longer in force, states have the power to pass new laws prohibiting abortion or to enforce old bans that are still on the books. the latter is an especially real possibility in michigan, where a 1931 law prohibits abortion at any stage of pregnancy and in almost all circumstances.the law is not being enforced at the moment, thanks to several lower court rulings that prevent prosecutors from bringing cases. but abortion rights opponents have appealed those decisions.the goal of the abortion rights amendment is to settle these questions once and for all, so that neither judges nor lawmakers could take away abortion access in michigan. and that idea appears to have a great deal of support.in july, organizers submitted petitions supporting the amendment with more than 750,000 signatures from across the state. that was nearly twice as many as necessary, and consistent with the strong support for abortion rights among michiganders that recent polling has detected.but opponents of the measure said those petitions were not valid, because of what was basically a series of typos: spaces between some of the words were not readily visible, thanks to a glitch in the printing. this made the petitions incomprehensible, opponents claimed, and thus not valid as proof the amendment had enough support to qualify for the ballot.last week, that argument prevailed with the two republicans who sit on michigan’s four-person election board. the two republicans voted against authorizing the amendment, producing a deadlock along party lines. if that had been the final word, the amendment would not be on the november ballot.but immediately after the elections board voted, the amendment’s supporters asked the state supreme court to intervene, arguing that the meaning of the amendment was clear even with the compressed words ― and that the elections board had no authority to block an initiative when it so clearly had enough public support.on thursday, the court agreed that the amendment’s meaning was clear, and ordered the election board to certify the amendment. the board next meets on friday, which is also the deadline for county clerks to finalize november ballot designs.the vote on the seven-member court was 5-2, and in a brief, unsigned opinion, the majority explained that “the meaning of the words has not changed by the alleged insufficient spacing between them.”but several justices chimed in with more thoughts ― including chief justice bridget mary mccormack, who was part of the majority and wrote a stinging concurring opinion.“seven hundred fifty three thousand and seven hundred fifty nine michiganders signed this proposal ― more than have ever signed any proposal in michigan’s history,” mccormack wrote.noting that the challengers produced no evidence that any voters were actually confused by the wording, mccormack accused those opponents of trying to “disenfranchise millions of michiganders ... because they think they have identified a technicality that allows them to do so, a game of gotcha gone very bad.”justice brian zahra, one of the two dissenters, had some pointed words of his own. he protested the decision to issue a ruling without oral argument, then zeroed in on the substantive dispute ― and why, in his opinion, it mattered.“the only thing more difficult to discern than the disputed portions of the text of the amendment is why the proponents of the amendment proceeded to circulate a petition that plainly did not conform to the form and content of the petition preapproved by the bureau of elections,” zahra wrote.the amendment’s placement on the ballot could have a significant effect on the outcome of other races, by increasing turnout among voters who support abortion rights.that is likely to help candidates who also support abortion rights ― including incumbent gov. gretchen whitmer (d) and attorney general dana nessel (d), both of whom are up for reelection and have made abortion a central focus of their campaigns.it could also help democrats seeking u.s. house seats, including several in tightly contested races whose outcomes could effectively determine which party controls the chamber starting in january.the caveat is that the polls could be wrong: the amendment might not be as popular as it seems. or sentiments could change as opponents hammer away at it.if that happens, then the amendment could fail and its supporters running for office could lose ― which, in the case of the governor’s race, would mean a victory for republican tudor dixon.dixon has said she supports the 1931 ban, including its lack of exceptions for rape and incest. if there’s no new amendment in the state constitution and she’s the one in the governor’s office, then abortion might not be legal in michigan for much longer.senior national correspondent, huffpost do you have information you want to share with huffpost? here’s how.by entering

(ap) — people with disabilities in portland, oregon, have sued the city, saying they can’t navigate its sidewalks because of sprawling homeless encampments.the federal class action lawsuit says the city has violated the americans with disabilities act by allowing homeless people’s tents to block city sidewalks, making it difficult for people using wheelchairs, walkers or canes to use them.“the entire class of persons with disabilities are regularly deprived of the benefits of services of the city of portland,” said john dilorenzo, lead counsel for the plaintiffs.the suit was filed tuesday in u.s. district court in portland.the plaintiffs include nine people with disabilities and a caretaker. among the plaintiffs is keith martin, a 71-year-old a portland resident who has used a wheelchair since having a stroke three years ago.“i couldn’t get to my breakfast in the morning because there was a tent covering the whole sidewalk,” martin said. “i was forced onto the street and narrowly missed a streetcar that came around the corner.”oregon’s homelessness crisis has been fueled by a housing shortage, the coronavirus pandemic and high drug addiction rates. federal data from the latest national survey on drug use and health found that 9% of teens and adults in oregon had illicit drug use disorders in 2020. that year, the state also ranked last in access to drug addiction treatment, according to the survey.the class action suit seeks to require the city to clear all sidewalks of tent encampments and debris, and to “construct, purchase, or otherwise provide for emergency shelters in which to house the unsheltered persons” who may be affected.such measures would make sidewalks accessible for people with disabilities in a safe manner while providing a safe place for unhoused people, dilorenzo said.portland mayor ted wheeler’s office said the mayor is meeting with the city attorney before providing comment.about 13% of portlanders live with a disability, according to the lawsuit, including 6% with mobility impairments and 2.4% with visual impairments.plaintiff steve jackson, 47, is legally blind and uses a cane to walk. he said tents prevent him from navigating the sidewalk and accessing bus stops.“often there’s tents blocking the entire sidewalk, where i don’t see them because they weren’t there the day before, and i hit the tent and then people are mad at me and think i’m attacking them,” jackson said during a news conference.there were about 3,000 unsheltered people living in multnomah county, home to portland, during the most recent point-in-time count in january 2022, county figures show.the portland city council declared a state of emergency on homelessness in 2015 and has extended it five times since then. the measure, now set to expire in 2025, reduces the bureaucratic hurdles surrounding the creation of homeless shelters.despite the city’s years-long emergency measure, the estimated number of people experiencing homelessness spiked 25% in the portland area between 2020 and 2022, according to point-in-time counts reported to the u.s. department of housing and urban development.this year alone, wheeler has issued four emergency declarations to address homelessness issues. most recently in august, he expanded a previous declaration that prohibits camping along high-speed corridors such as highways to include key walking routes to k-12 schools.the state has wrestled with a debate over the best way to reduce homelessness. some business groups have called for more encampment sweeps and stricter enforcement of anti-camping ordinances, while others want more investment in social services and affordable housing.oregon lawmakers earlier this year approved a budget that includes $400 million to address homelessness and housing.____claire rush is a corps member for the associated press/report for america statehouse news initiative. report for america is a nonprofit national service program

province, state media said. the fire was brought under control quickly but smoldered into the next day.vietnam news agency reported 32 deaths from the blaze as of late wednesday and at least one karaoke room and one storage room have not been accessed because the temperature remained high.some people were injured from asphyxiation and others suffered broken limbs when they jumped from upper floors to try to escape the fire, reports said. firefighters using ladders from their trucks managed to rescue others.president nguyen xuan phuc extended his condolences to families of the victims and asked government officials to support the families and quickly find the cause of the blaze. the preliminary finding was that it was caused by an electrical short circuit and started on the second or third floor.enforcement of safety standards at entertainment venues in many parts of southeast asia is sometimes lax and believed to contribute to multiple deaths in case of fires.police in thailand said that a pub in the eastern province of chonburi was presenting live entertainment without a license when a fire broke out in early august, trapping many people inside because exits were blocked or locked.the toll from that fire has climbed to 23 dead, 13 of them on the night of the blaze and 10 in the month since then. many had serious burns over most of their bodies, which are extremely

major league baseball players association plans to join the afl-cio labor federation, putting one of professional sports’ top unions in a formal alliance with other labor groups.tony clark, the former switch-hitting first baseman who is now the union’s director, announced the new affiliation at the national press club in downtown washington on wednesday. he was joined by liz shuler, president of the afl-cio, which includes 57 other unions representing more than 12 million workers.clark said the pandemic-shortened 2020 season and the lockout that preceded the current season prompted the union to think about its own place in the labor movement.“the truth is we reflected on where our organization was and the things we could potentially do moving forward as part of the broader labor discussion,” clark said.the afl-cio functions as a powerful lobby for organized labor in washington, looking out for the interests of its member unions legislatively, and acts as a bridge between unions operating in different industries. the federation was formed in 1955 in a marriage between the american federation of labor and the congress of industrial organizations.the mlbpa represents around 1,200 baseball players, many of whom make a lot of money. by joining the afl-cio, the union will be affiliated with many working-class unions, including unite here, which represents thousands of concessions workers at baseball stadiums around the country. the afl-cio also includes the nfl players association and the national women’s soccer league players association. the national basketball players association is not a member. the baseball players union joins the federation at a time when it’s trying to organize more workers. the mlbpa announced tuesday that it had gathered union authorization cards from more than half of minor league players. that would be more than enough cards to trigger a union election under the national labor relations board, but the union has asked major league baseball to voluntarily recognize the minor league union.clark said the mlbpa hoped to “strengthen our player fraternity” by organizing minor leaguers and improving their working conditions, noting that many struggle to scrape by on extremely low wages.“the minor league players are the backbone of our industry,” clark said. “it’s important that they have a voice at the table.”the potential bargaining unit in the minor leagues would include more than 5,000 players, a large organizing effort for the mlbpa. there may be ways the afl-cio could assist in that effort and help amplify the union’s message. shuler called the minor league campaign “an inspiration.”“people often think that being a professional athlete means you’re just set up for life,” she said. “i think there are a lot of misperceptions out there about that. minor league players are dealing with poverty wages ... and a chronic lack of respect.”unions typically pay per-capita taxes to be members of the afl-cio, meaning workers indirectly fund their union’s membership. clark did not get into the specifics of the mlbpa’s arrangement with the afl-cio, but said players recognized that “now was the time” to join.“whether you’re working on the pitch or on a baseball field or on a construction site, we’re all concerned about safe workplaces.”george atallah, a spokesperson for the nfl players union, said it was important for all of the sports unions to be “aligned” with one another as well as the other unions on the periphery of their industries. being part of the afl-cio can help accomplish that, he said.“when we were locked out in 2011, the first people who came to our aid were the steelworkers, the hotel workers, the communications workers. they were all there for us,” atallah said. “solidarity is not just one union within itself but from one union to another.” the major league baseball owners locked out the players ahead of the 2022 season for three months before both sides reached a new 5-year collective bargaining agreement.matthew loeb, president of the international alliance of theatrical stage employees, said wednesday that the work stoppage showed how much “common interest” players have with other workers, noting that many of his union’s members in broadcasting weren’t able to work until the lockout was resolved.shuler said there was “no question” that major league ballplayers have a large platform, and that their star power could help the afl-cio and its member unions in their battles with employers. but she said that wasn’t the significance of the mlbpa joining.“the point here is we’re all workers, and we all have the same struggles,” shuler said. “whether you’re working on the pitch or on a baseball field or on a construction site, we’re all concerned about safe workplaces.”labor reporter, huffpostby entering your email and clicking sign up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our

only account for 1% of characters on popular television shows, according to a report released wednesday.the findings, which come from an analysis of 200 top-rated television shows aired in the u.s., u.k., australia and new zealand between 2018 and 2019, indicate yet again that the global entertainment industry has either sidelined muslim voices entirely or cast muslim actors in roles rooted in stereotypes. “what we’re seeing is content creators and casting directors that have no imagination,” said stacy smith, the founder of the university of southern california’s annenberg inclusion initiative and the lead author of the study.“this is people being lazy with a group of people that routinely are being dehumanized as either perpetrators or victims of violence, or with disparaging comments.”such storylines can contribute to a host of concerns in the real world, including aggression toward and fear of muslims, smith said.the report, titled “erased or extremists: the stereotypical view of muslims in popular episodic series,” was released with support from the usc initiative, pillars fund and the ford foundation, as well as actor riz ahmed and his production company, left handed films.among the shows review as part of the study, 87% did not feature a single muslim character. the 200 scripted series included just 98 muslim characters out of 8,885 speaking roles — a ratio of about 1-to-90.when muslim characters did make an appearance on screen, they were largely portrayed as violent or foreign, and referred to with words like “terrorist,” “predator” and “monster.” thirty percent of the muslim characters in the sample perpetrated violent acts against another character, and nearly 40% were targets of violence.despite the fact that muslims are the most racially and ethnically diverse religious group in the world, the majority of speaking muslim characters were depicted as middle eastern or north african. only 13% of all muslim characters were shown as native to countries that are not majority muslim. meanwhile, two were depicted as immigrants.of all the speaking muslim characters in the scripted series, about 70% were male and 30% were female. muslim girls and women on screen typically faced some sort of distress, including emotional duress or physical danger. “we didn’t see them really leading their own storylines or showing them in empowering roles — which, again, creates this light that muslim women cannot be leaders and they cannot be empowered,” said al-baab khan, one of the authors of the study.she said such depictions are harmful because they reinforce the image of muslim women “as being oppressed, as being fearful or as being less-than, which is not true.”a separate study released by the same researchers last year found that fewer than 2% of movie characters with speaking roles were muslim.“we see that even across all media content in film and tv ... muslims are extremely erased on screen. and that poses a huge issue because when we think about muslims in the real world, we make up a quarter of the world’s population,” khan said.“it’s really hard to even justify such a disproportionate representation on screen. and it’s really sad because growing up in america, you want to be able to see your own community.”the issue isn’t unique to muslims. hollywood has long faced criticism for its abysmal track record on diversity and the lack of black, asian, hispanic and latino actors in lead roles. pillars, which issues financial grants to muslim groups, put up a billboard in los angeles ahead of next week’s primetime emmy awards to highlight data from the new report and start an overdue conversation about the lack of muslim representation in the industry.“we wanted to use emmy award season to have folks consider something else, which is that the quantity and quality of characters on screen has a huge impact on the daily lived experiences of muslims around the globe,” said arij mikati, the managing director of culture change at pillars.but for decades, she said, television has not included the “beauty, joy, diversity, and richness of our communities and muslim communities.”“representation for representation’s sake is certainly not our goal. the quality and content of characters on screen have a really massive impact on how people all around the world feel about muslims and also how muslims feel about themselves,” she added.“film can act as a way for audiences to identify with muslims, and i really believe it’s an opportunity to create greater empathy for and less prejudice towards muslims off-screen.”shows depicting muslim lead characters with nuance are slowly becoming more common.“ms. marvel,” which features the first muslim superhero in marvel studios’ “cinematic universe,” debuted on disney+ earlier this year and quickly became one of the production company’s highest-rated projects.meanwhile, netflix’s “mo” — based on the life of muslim comedian mo amer — documents the story of a palestinian refugee in houston. and last year, the british sitcom “we are lady parts,” which follows a punk band made up of muslim women, premiered on peacock.“we know that people are hungry for those stories. they are unique and relatable, and we’re really excited to invite other americans to learn more about our vibrant communities,” mikati said. “this is an opportunity for the industry to see the talent that has long existed in abundance.”reporter, huffpostby entering your email and clicking sign up, you're agreeing to let us send you

one knows exactly when the next recession will happen, but layoff victims will certainly fall into a safety net that is weaker than ever. after congress turbocharged jobless benefits in response to the coronavirus pandemic, lawmakers in three states have already slashed the state-funded benefits that are the foundation of the unemployment insurance system. lawmakers at the federal level, meanwhile, have lost all appetite for improving the system even after the pandemic exposed its flaws on a national scale. and it’s hard to imagine congress stepping in with another temporary expansion of benefits as republicans continue to blame high inflation on the extra benefits democrats approved last year. “we’ve seen incredible gridlock in congress to pass things that are overwhelmingly popular with the public, like the $15 minimum wage,” rebecca dixon, director of the national employment law project, told huffpost. “i think we could get to a place where there is a crisis and congress can’t get out of gridlock and address it.”in response to every recession since the 1950s, congress has added additional weeks of benefits to the standard 26 provided by states. after lawmakers temporarily added 73 weeks of benefits in the wake of the great recession, republicans in 10 states permanently cut the duration of their underlying state programs.the give-and-take pattern ramped up with the coronavirus pandemic. congress added weeks of benefits in 2020 and also took the unprecedented steps of temporarily boosting the weekly value of benefits by $600 and expanding eligibility to include workers without traditional payroll jobs, such as rideshare drivers.republican governors in 25 states then took the unprecedented step of rejecting extra federal benefits in 2021. state legislatures in 10 states also took up bills cutting benefits, according to andrew stettner, director of workforce policy at the century foundation, a progressive think tank. “there was some bad activity last session and we expect some of these states will come back for more,” stettner said in an email. only iowa, kentucky and oklahoma permanently cut benefits in the last legislative session. kentucky’s new law also imposed stricter work search requirements; iowa’s requires unemployment recipients to accept jobs at lower wages. iowa republican state representative michael bousselot said the safety net should be less of a safety net and more of a trampoline that bounces layoff victims back into jobs. “what we are proposing to do is to refocus unemployment on ‘re-employment,’ rather than just being a safety net,” bousselot said in march. republicans at the state and federal levels blamed extra benefits for causing a “worker shortage” in 2021, but businesses have continued to complain of worker shortages long after the supplemental benefits disappeared. one of the most important changes congress made in 2020 allowed the self-employed and independent contractors, such as uber drivers, to apply for benefits for the first time in the history of the state-federal unemployment insurance system. the pandemic unemployment assistance program paid workers who were ineligible for regular unemployment because they didn’t have a history of payroll earnings on file with their state government. a bloomberg investigation showed that in the first year of the pandemic, black workers in georgia were more likely than their white counterparts to be denied regular benefits; the special pandemic benefits helped close some of the gap in benefits coverage. but the program might be better known for fraud than for reducing racial disparities.“it’s so hard to bring attention to this program when there’s not a crisis.”progressive democrats want to reform the unemployment system so that it covers nontraditional workers, reduces variation among states and stops states from slashing benefits. and they want to upgrade out-of-date information technology used by many state workforce agencies. some workers had to wait several months for benefits due to the strain an unprecedented surge in claims put on antiquated state systems.but democrats omitted the proposals even from the most expansive version of the domestic policy bill they wound up whittling down and passing last month as the inflation reduction act. there’s no hope of its return in the immediate future. dixon said it would likely take another crisis to create a window of opportunity for congress. “it’s so hard to bring attention to this program when there’s not a crisis,” she said. many economists expect a recession and widespread job losses sometime in the next year as the federal reserve raises interest rates in order to tame inflation by slowing the overall economy. job growth has remained strong, but there are potential warning signs. matt darling, an employment policy fellow at the niskanen center, a center-right think tank, has pointed to widening gaps between the unemployment rates for college-educated workers and those with no higher education, as well as between white workers and black workers. two of the numbers i track closely are the gaps between college and non-college educated workers, and the gap between black and white workers.both are sharply up right now, which is concerning. #beyondthenumbers https://t.co/nxdd9uxhhx pic.twitter.com/wndliaessy“if we are seeing the effects of the federal reserve’s [rate hikes], these are the places we’d expect to see them first,” darling said in an interview. it’s possible that the widening gaps represent “noise” in the data, but it could be that layoffs have begun to increase for the more vulnerable members of the american workforce.dixon said she didn’t think a recession caused by interest rate hikes would be as bad as the one caused by the pandemic or the one caused by the financial crisis more than a decade earlier. but she does expect a familiar pattern in who gets hurt the most.“i don’t know that there’ll necessarily be widespread pain from the recession, if we have one in the near term, but there will be pain,” she said. “and the people who experience the most pain are also the ones who are most likely to be locked out of the ui system.”senior reporter, huffpost do you have information you want to share with huffpost? here’s how.by entering your email and

other things at the (plant) that force us to prepare the local population for the consequences of the nuclear danger,” reznichenko said.the potential peril led the u.n. atomic watchdog agency to urge russia and ukraine to establish a “nuclear safety and security protection zone” around the plant.there are fears the fighting could trigger a catastrophe on the scale of the chernobyl disaster in 1986. the plant was built during the soviet era and is one of the 10 biggest in the world.neither moscow nor kiev officials would immediately commit to the idea of a safety zone, saying more details of the proposal were needed.russian president vladimir putin defied pressure to halt the war, saying wednesday that moscow will forge ahead with its military offensive in ukraine until it achieves its goals. he also mocked western attempts to stop russia with sanctions.the eastern city of sloviansk came under russian fire on wednesday morning, damaging a school and another building, according to the head of the city administration vadym lyakh. he said the number of injuries wasn’t yet known.three civilians were killed in russian shelling in the donetsk region, the ukrainian presidential office said. kharkiv city was hit by rockets twice during the night.but ukrainian forces have taken control of an unspecified number of towns in the kherson region, according to nataliya humenyuk, a spokesperson for the southern military command. she said details would come later from the military leadership.the u.k. defense ministry said there had been heavy fighting on three fronts: in the north, near kharkiv; in the east in the donbas; and in the south in kherson oblast.amid a ukrainian counterattack in the east, “multiple concurrent threats spread across 500 kilometers (310 miles) will test russia’s ability to coordinate operational design and reallocate resources across multiple groupings of forces,” the ministry said wednesday.the russian military held large-scale military drills that began last week and ended wednesday in the country’s east that involved forces from china. it was seen as another show of increasingly close ties between moscow and beijing amid tensions with the west over the military action in ukraine.___follow the ap’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraineby entering your email and clicking sign up, you're agreeing to let us

a ransomware attack targeting the huge los angeles school district prompted an unprecedented shutdown of its computer systems as schools increasingly find themselves vulnerable to cyber breaches at the start of a new year.the attack on the los angeles unified school district sounded alarms across the country, from urgent talks with the white house and the national security council after the first signs of ransomware were discovered late saturday night to mandated password changes for 540,000 students and 70,000 district employees.though the attack used technology that encrypts data and won’t unlock it unless a ransom is paid, in this case the district’s superintendent said no immediate demand for money was made and schools in the nation’s second-largest district opened as scheduled on tuesday.such attacks have become a growing threat to u.s. schools, with several high-profile incidents reported since last year as pandemic-forced reliance on technology increases the impact. and ransomware gangs have in the past planned major attacks on u.s. holiday weekends, when they know it staffing will be thin and security experts relaxing.while it was not immediately clear when the la attack began — officials have only said when it was detected and a district spokesperson declined to answer additional questions — saturday night’s discovery reached the highest levels of the federal government’s cybersecurity agencies.according to a senior administration official, this pattern of support was consistent with the biden administration’s efforts to provide maximum assistance to critical industries affected by such breaches.the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the federal response, said the school district did not pay ransom, but would not get into detail on what potentially might have been stolen or damaged and what systems were affected by the breach.the white house’s response to the la incursion reflects a growing national security concern: a pew research center survey, published last month, found that 71% of americans say cyberattacks from other countries are a major threat to the u.s.authorities believe the la attack originated internationally and have identified three potential countries where it may have come from, though la superintendent alberto carvalho would not say which countries may be involved. most ransomware criminals are russian speakers who operate without interference from the kremlin.la officials did not identify the ransomware used.“this was an act of cowardice,” said nick melvoin, the school board vice president. “a criminal act against kids, against their teachers and against an education system.”so far this year, 26 u.s. school districts — including los angeles — and 24 colleges and universities have been hit by so-called ransomware, according to brett callow, a ransomware analyst at the cybersecurity firm emsisoft.with victims increasingly refusing to pay to have their data unlocked, many cybercriminals instead use the same technology to steal sensitive information and demand extortion payments. if the victim doesn’t pay, the data gets dumped online.callow said at least 31 of the schools hit this year had data stolen and released online, and noted that eight of the school districts have been hit since aug. 1. the upsurge on schools as summer vacations end is almost certainly not coincidental, he said.“it is the no. 1 threat to our safety,” said michel moore, chief of the los angeles police department. “it is an invisible foe and it is tireless.”tireless — and expensive, even outside of any monetary demands. a ransomware extortion attack in albuquerque’s biggest school district forced schools to close for two days in january, while baltimore city’s response to a 2019 hit on its computer servers cost upwards of $18 million.the la attack was discovered around 10:30 p.m. saturday when staff first detected “unusual activity,” carvalho said. the perpetrators appear to have targeted the facilities systems, which involves information about private-sector contractor payments — which are publicly available through records requests — rather than confidential details like payroll, health and other data.he said district it officials detected the malware and stopped it from propagating but not until after it infected key network systems, necessitating the reset of passwords for all staff and students.authorities scrambled to trace the intruders and restrict potential damage.“we basically shut down every one of our systems,” carvalho said, noting that each one had been checked and all but one — the facilities system — restarted by late monday night, when the district first notified the public of the hit.on tuesday, federal authorities separately warned of potential ransomware attacks by the criminal syndicate known as vice society, which has allegedly disproportionately targeted the education sector.authorities have not said whether they believe vice society is involved in the la attack and the group did not respond to a request for comment on tuesday.“the fact that a joint cybersecurity advisory relating to vice society was issued within days of the attack on lausd being discovered may be telling, especially as this gang has frequently targeted the education sector in both the u.s. and the u.k.,” said callow, the ransomware expert.vice society first appeared in may 2021 and, rather than a unique variant, it has used ransomware widely available in the russian-speaking underground, security researchers say. among victims claimed by vice society are the elmbrook school district in wisconsin and the savannah college of art and design.ransomware gangs routinely dissolve after high-profile attacks such as last year’s colonial pipeline incident, which triggered runs on gas stations. their members then reconstitute under new names.while there was pressure to cancel school in los angeles on tuesday, officials ultimately decided to stay open.had the activity not been discovered on saturday night, carvalho said there could have been “catastrophic” consequences.“if we had lost the ability to run our school buses, over 40,000 of our students would not have been able to get to school, or it would have been a highly disrupted system,” he said.the district plans to do a forensic audit of the attack to see what can be done to prevent future incursions.“every teacher, every employee, every student can be a weak point,” said soheil katal, the district’s chief information officer.___bajak reported from

rookie utility player — and son of seven-time cy young award winner roger clemens — caught shohei ohtani looking late in monday night’s 10-0 loss to the los angeles angels.mopping up in the eighth inning, clemens froze last year’s al mvp with a 68 mph pitch on the outside corner for his first major league strikeout and gave an exuberant strike three call on the mound.i'd save the ball

super cool,” clemens said. “he’s the best player in baseball. so it’s a pretty cool moment for me.”grinning ear to ear, the 26-year-old clemens tossed the souvenir ball into the dugout for safe keeping and is hoping to get it signed by the angels’ two-way star during the final two days of the series.“it was a wonderful pitch,” ohtani said through his interpreter.by far the hardest one of their encounter, too.ohtani fouled off a 54 mph delivery from clemens, took a 57 mph pitch for a ball and then fouled off a 56 mph offering.“i mean, obviously can’t do it slow enough for ohtani. maybe you can throw it slow and slow and slow and then maybe surprise him with a fastball,” detroit manager a.j. hinch said. “big smile on kody’s face, and shohei tipped his cap.”those were four of the seven slowest pitches ohtani has faced this season, according to mlb statcast. the other three were by tampa bay outfielder brett phillips, including a 53 mph “fastball” during the angels’ 12-0 victory on may 12, when reid detmers threw a no-hitter for los angeles.clemens was pitching for the third time in the past seven days to save detroit’s bullpen with the game out of reach. he worked

announced water pressure is solid and back to normal in jackson, as the city continues to battle long-standing infrastructure issues, which intensified after flooding affected the city’s main water treatment facility.the crisis left residents of jackson unable to flush their toilets but also meant the city would have been unable to meet critical needs, including fighting fires.“i am very happy to report that we have returned water pressure to the city,” reeves said in a statement. “the tanks are full or filling. there are currently zero water tanks at low levels.”we have restored water pressure to jackson. pic.twitter.com/e3bv4zvkkzthe city’s public schools announced they would open for in-person learning tuesday after water pressure was deemed “suitable” for students to return. forest hill high school students, though, will have to access alternate learning sites, as water pressure hasn’t been restored in that location.the school district warned the air conditioning in some schools may also be affected and could take a while to reach low temperatures.pic.twitter.com/r8x9icopdmadditional challenges are likely to remain for jackson. “this system broke over several years, and it would be inaccurate to claim it is totally solved over a week,” reeves said.he continued: “there may be more bad days in the future.”residents are still advised to boil their drinking water, with officials saying the notice — which went into effect july 30 — will be lifted once they get two rounds of clear samples. the director of the federal emergency management agency on sunday said “it’s still too early to tell” when the city will have access to safe drinking water.“the focus right now is making sure we can get bottled water out,” deanne criswell told cnn’s “state of the union.”“the longer term and the mid-term about how long it’s going to take to actually make it safe to drink ― i think that we have a lot more to learn about what it’s going to take to get that plant up and running,” criswell continued.jackson mayor chokwe antar lumumba attributed the challenges to the city’s long-standing water infrastructure issues, warning there is a long road ahead to establish sustainable and reliable water systems.“as i have always warned, even when the pressure’s restored, even when we are not under a boil water notice, it’s not a matter of if these systems will fail, but when these systems will fail,” lumumba told abc’s “this week.” “there are so many points of failure. we’re talking about a set of accumulated challenges that have taken place over the better part of 30 years.”lumumba has previously said fixing the issue could cost billions of dollars. mississippi is due to receive $75 million as part of the bipartisan infrastructure legislation president joe biden signed into law last year, according to the associated press. the majority-black city has a population of 150,000 and an additional 30,000 also rely on its water system. this is not the first time the city’s water system has experienced failure. just last year, a winter storm caused frozen and burst pipes at the o.b. curtis water treatment plant, which was effectively shut down,

facebook, more than $400 million for violations of data privacy laws related to information about children on instagram.the irish data protection commission levied the fine against meta for violations of the general data protection regulation, or gdpr, earlier this month, politico first reported. the privacy law was implemented in 2018 and gives special protection to children’s data linked to social media accounts, video games and other internet sites.the new york times added the irish regulator first opened an investigation in 2020 amid reports instagram made the accounts of users aged 13

influencers, the times reported.it’s the second-highest fine ever handed down under the gdpr, after a $742 million penalty against amazon.meta said it had since updated its privacy settings and “released many new features to help keen teens safe and their information private.” it said it planned to appeal the decision.“anyone under 18 automatically has their account set to private when they join instagram, so only people they know can see what they post, and adults can’t message teens who don’t follow them,” the company told politico in a statement. “we engaged fully with the dpc throughout their inquiry, and we’re carefully reviewing their final decision.”it’s the third time meta has faced fines in ireland. the times notes the social media behemoth has its european headquarters in the country, which requires irish regulators to uphold the european union’s gdpr standards. the company was fined $223 million last year for violations on its messaging platform,

begins tuesday in uvalde.there is new high fencing around the texas community’s public school campuses that still isn’t finished, a heavy police patrol that many families don’t trust and no classes ever again at robb elementary school, three months after a gunman with an ar-15-style rifle killed 19 children and two teachers inside two adjoining fourth-grade classrooms.ashley morales is putting her son, jeremiah, back in class — because she says she has no other choice as a working single mother. she will drop him off outside uvalde elementary on the first day. she says parents won’t be allowed inside.“i’m just nervous, scared,” said morales, whose son was a third-grader last year at robb elementary and lost three friends in the may 24 massacre. during a recent “meet the teacher” night, she felt a rush of anxiety walking down the school hall.“oh my gosh, it’s actually going to happen,” she said. “school is going to start.”although school already started weeks ago in many parts of texas, officials pushed back the first day of class in uvalde after a summer of unfathomable heartache, anger and revelations of widespread failures by law enforcement who allowed an 18-year-old gunman to fire inside the adjoining classrooms for more than 70 minutes.despite pushing back the start of the year, uvalde school officials said several enhanced security measures remain incomplete, including installing additional cameras and new locks.the texas department of public safety has committed to putting nearly three dozen state troopers on uvalde campuses — but that is of no comfort to some families since there were more than 90 state troopers on scene during the attack.more than 100 families in uvalde signed up for virtual school, while others pulled their kids out of the district and enrolled them in private schools. one teacher who was shot in the abdomen and survived, elsa avila, will not be greetings students for the first time in 30 years because she is still recovering.a damning report by a texas house committee found that nearly 400 officers in all rushed to robb elementary after the shooting but hesitated for more than hour to confront the shooter. body camera and surveillance footage showed heavily armed officers, some holding bulletproof shields, stacked in the hallway but not advancing to the classroom.steve mccraw, head of the texas department of public safety, called the response “an abject failure.”last month, the uvalde school board fired district police chief pete arredondo, who mccraw and the house report accused of failing to take control of the scene and wasting time by looking for a key for a classroom door that was likely unlocked. the firing has not quieted demands for others to face punishment. one other officer — uvalde lt. mariano pargas, the acting police chief that day — has been placed on administrative leave.by entering your email and clicking sign up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about
